#: CircleCI 2.0 configuration file.
#:
#: Understanding CircleCI 'docker' executor.
#:
#: CircleCI uses "runner" container (created from specified Docker image)
#: to checkout source code and run commands defined in this file.
#: Application Docker containers (the ones defined in docker-compose.yml)
#: run on *remote* docker server, started by CircleCI as a part of their stack.
#: The "runner" container uses Docker client to control remote Docker server
#: (when used locally, Docker bundles both client and server into a single
#: "Docker" application, so you may not even know that these are two different
#: services).
#:
#: Because Docker images use layers, it is possible to cache Docker images
#: between builds to significantly speedup application provisioning for each
#: job (it requires enabling of Docker Layer Caching feature in CircleCI by
#: lodging a support request).

#; Comments starting with '#;', '#;<' or '#;>' (like the ones used for the

#; removed for your project. They are automatically removed when installing
