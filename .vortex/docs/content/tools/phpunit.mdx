# PHPUnit – The PHP Testing Framework

https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/

> PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured PHPCS ruleset](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/phpunit.xml) for Drupal projects.

## Usage

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-unit                              # Run Unit tests.
    ahoy test-kernel                            # Run Kernel tests.
    ahoy test-functional                        # Run Functional tests.
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit                          # Run all tests.
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=unit         # Run Unit tests.
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=kernel       # Run Kernel tests.
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=functional   # Run Functional tests.
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running all tests in the file

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-unit path/to/MyTest.php
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit path/to/MyTest.php
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running selected tests by name

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-unit --filter=MyTest
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit -- --filter=MyTest
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Running tagged tests with `@group group_name` annotation**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-unit --group=group_name
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpunit -- --group=group_name
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/10.4/configuration.html).

All global configuration takes place in the [`phpunit.xml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/phpunit.xml) file.

By default, PHPUnit will run tests for custom modules and themes, Drupal
settings and continuous integration configuration.

The recommended way to adding test targets is via using test suites:

```xml
<testsuite name="unit">
  <directory>my/custom/dir/*/tests</directory>
</testsuite>

```

Run checks against platform version specified in `composer.json` key `config.platform.php`:

```xml
<config name="testVersion" value="8.1"/>
```

## Coverage

PHPUnit is configured to generate code coverage reports. The reports are stored
in `.logs/coverage/phpunit/cobertura.xml`
as [Cobertura XML](https://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/), suitable for
automated coverage assessment, and in `.logs/coverage/phpunit/.coverage-html` as
HTML coverage report, useful for visual report assessment during test
development.

Continuous integration pipeline runs tests with coverage by default and stores
the reports as artifacts.

### Coverage threshold

CI enforces a minimum coverage threshold. If coverage falls below the threshold,
the build fails. Set `VORTEX_CI_CODE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` to configure the
minimum percentage (default: `90`).

### PR comments

Coverage reports are posted as PR comments automatically. Set
`VORTEX_CI_CODE_COVERAGE_PR_COMMENT_SKIP` to `1` to disable.

### Ignoring lines from coverage

Sometimes it is necessary to ignore lines from coverage. For example, when
testing a module that uses a third-party library, it is not necessary to test
the library itself.

To ignore a method from coverage, add `@codeCoverageIgnore` annotation to the
method docblock.

```php
/**
 * @codeCoverageIgnore
 */
public function myMethod() {
  // ...
}
```

To ignore a line from coverage, add `@codeCoverageIgnoreStart` and
`@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd` annotations before the first and after the last line.

```php
// @codeCoverageIgnoreStart
$a = 1;
$b = 2;
// @codeCoverageIgnoreEnd
```

## Ignoring fail in continuous integration pipeline

This tool runs in continuous integration pipeline by default and fails the build
if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_PHPUNIT_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
