# Doctor

Doctor is a standalone, self-contained script designed to
inspect the current state of your project. Its primary functions include
checking project requirements and displaying system information.

Also, it runs before and after you build the project with `ahoy build` to make
sure that all the requirements are met.

## Features

Doctor script performs a series of checks to ensure the project
environment is correctly set up:

- Availability of the necessary tools (Docker, Docker Compose, Pygmy, Ahoy etc.)
- Port availability on the host machine
- Pygmy availability
- Container status
- Presence of SSH key within a container
- Webserver status
- Application bootstrap status

## Checking project status

```bash
$ ahoy doctor

[INFO] Checking project requirements
[ OK ] All required tools are present.
[ OK ] Port 80 is available.
[ OK ] Pygmy is running.
[ OK ] All containers are running
[ OK ] SSH key is available within CLI container.
[ OK ] Web server is running and accessible at http://vortex.docker.amazee.io.
[ OK ] Bootstrapped website at http://vortex.docker.amazee.io.
[ OK ] All required checks have passed.
```

## Getting system information

```bash
$ ahoy doctor info
