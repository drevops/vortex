# DCLint

https://github.com/zavoloklom/docker-compose-linter

> A command-line tool for validating and enforcing best practices in Docker Compose files.

**Vortex** does not install DCLint. Please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/zavoloklom/docker-compose-linter#installation) to install it on your system.

## Usage

```shell
dclint docker-compose.yml
```

## Ignoring

To ignore **all DCLint rules** within a file, place in the file header:

```yaml
# dclint disable
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: ubuntu
```

To ignore only **specific rules**:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  # dclint disable-next-line no-version-field
  app:
    image: ubuntu
```

## Ignoring fail in continuous integration pipeline

This tool runs in continuous integration pipeline by default and fails the build
if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_DCLINT_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
