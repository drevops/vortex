> The missing checkstyle for twig!

> Twig CS Fixer aims to be what phpcs is to php. It checks your codebase for violations on coding standards.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured Twig-cs-fixer ruleset](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/.twig-cs-fixer.php) for Drupal projects.

## Usage

```shell
vendor/bin/twig-cs-fixer
```
or
```shell
ahoy lint-fe
```

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://github.com/VincentLanglet/Twig-CS-Fixer/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).

All global configuration takes place in the [`.twig-cs-fixer.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/.twig-cs-fixer.php) file.

Targets include custom modules and themes.

Adding or removing targets:
```php
$finder = new TwigCsFixer\File\Finder();
$finder->in(__DIR__ . '/web/modules/custom');
$finder->in(__DIR__ . '/web/themes/custom');
```

## Ignoring

Ignoring rules **globally** takes place in the  [`.twig-cs-fixer.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/.twig-cs-fixer.php) file:
```php
$finder->exclude('myCustomDirectory');
```

All errors have an identifier with the syntax: `A.B:C:D` with
- `A`: The rule short name (mainly made from the class name)
- `B`: The error identifier (like the error level or a specific name)
- `C`: The line the error occurs
- `D`: The position of the token in the line the error occurs

The four parts are optional, all those format are working
- `A`
- `A.B`
- `A.B:C`
- `A.B:C:D`
- `A:C`
- `A:C:D`
- `A::D`

If you need to know the errors identifier you have/want to ignore, you can run
the linter command with the `--debug` option.

To ignore **all Twig CS Fixer rules** within a file, place in the file header:
```twig
{# twig-cs-fixer-disable #}
```

To ignore **a specific rule** within a file, place in the file header:
```twig
{# twig-cs-fixer-disable A.B:C:D #}
```

Twig CS Fixer does not support ignoring of the **code blocks**.

To ignore only the **current line**:
```twig
{# twig-cs-fixer-disable-next-line A.B:C:D #}
```

To ignore only the **next line**:
```twig
{# twig-cs-fixer-disable-line A.B:C:D #}
```

## Ignoring fail in CI

This tool runs in CI by default and fails the build if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_TWIG_CS_FIXER_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to
ignore failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
