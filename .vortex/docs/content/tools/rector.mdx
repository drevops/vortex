# Rector - Instant Upgrades and Automated Refactoring

https://github.com/rectorphp/rector

> Rector instantly upgrades and refactors the PHP code of your application.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured Rector configuration](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/rector.php)
for Drupal projects. The configuration is based on
the configuration provided
by [Drupal Rector](https://github.com/palantirnet/drupal-rector).

## Usage

### Check for violations

```shell
vendor/bin/rector --dry-run # Only see the diff of changes, do not save them to files.
```
or
```shell
ahoy lint-be
```

### Fix violations

```shell
vendor/bin/rector process
```
or
```shell
ahoy lint-fix
```

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://getrector.com/documentation).

All global configuration takes place in
the [`rector.php`](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/rector.php)
file.

Targets include custom modules and themes, settings and tests.

### Config sets

Rector provides [config sets](https://getrector.com/documentation/set-lists)
functionality that allows to enable/disable rules in bulk.

Vortex provides the config sets for Drupal 8 and Drupal 9 deprecated code and
code style fixes.

The config sets are meant to be adjusted per-project as needed.

A full list of available config sets can be found in
the [Rules overview](https://getrector.com/documentation/rules-overview) page.

```php
$rectorConfig->sets([
    // Provided by Rector.
    SetList::PHP_80,
    SetList::PHP_81,
    SetList::CODE_QUALITY,
    SetList::CODING_STYLE,
    SetList::DEAD_CODE,
    SetList::INSTANCEOF,
    SetList::TYPE_DECLARATION,
    // Provided by Drupal Rector.
    Drupal8SetList::DRUPAL_8,
    Drupal9SetList::DRUPAL_9,
    Drupal10SetList::DRUPAL_10,
]);
```

## Ignoring

See more
on [Ignoring Rules Or Paths](https://getrector.com/documentation/ignoring-rules-or-paths)
page.

Ignoring rules **globally** takes place in
the [`rector.php`](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/rector.php) file:

```php
$rectorConfig->skip([
  SimplifyIfReturnBoolRector::class,
]);
```

To ignore **all Rector rules** within a file:
```php
$rectorConfig->skip([
  'file.php',
  '*/other_file.php',
]);
```

To ignore **a specific rule** within a file:
```php
$rectorConfig->skip([
  SimplifyIfReturnBoolRector::class => ['file.php'],
]);
```

Rector does not support ignoring of the **code blocks**.

## Ignoring fail in CI

This tool runs in CI by default and fails the build if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_RECTOR_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
