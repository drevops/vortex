# Drush

https://www.drush.org/

> Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush
> core ships with lots of useful commands and generators. Similarly, it runs
> update.php, executes SQL queries, runs content migrations, and misc utilities
> like cron or cache rebuild. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

Drush is used throughout **Vortex** to interact with Drupal from the automation
scripts and Behat tests.

It also allows a developer to interact with the site via CLI during development.

While all the standard Drush commands supported, **Vortex** also provides some
shorthand commands to abstract some of the common tasks:

- downloading the database dump from the remote environment
- importing the database dump into the local environment
- running database updates and clearing caches

➡️ See [Development](/docs/development)

## Usage

Drush should be used from the inside of the container.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy drush <command>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli drush <command>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Aliases

For Lagoon hosting, Drush site aliases are automatically generated for each
environment and can be used either from the host machine or from within the
container.

    1. Make sure your SSH key is loaded in your `ssh-agent`:
    ```shell
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/path/to/key
    ```
    2. Run Drush commands using the Lagoon site aliases:
    ```shell
    drush @lagoon.develop status  # Show status of the develop environment
    drush @lagoon.pr-123 ssh      # SSH into the web container of the PR-123 environment
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy">
    1. Make sure your SSH key is loaded into `pygmy`:
    ```shell
    pygmy addkey --key ~/.ssh/path/to/key
    ```
    2. Run Drush commands using the Lagoon site aliases:
    ```shell
    ahoy drush @lagoon.develop status  # Show status of the develop environment
    ahoy drush @lagoon.pr-123 ssh      # SSH into the web container of the PR-123 environment
