# Drush

https://www.drush.org/

> Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush
> core ships with lots of useful commands and generators. Similarly, it runs
> update.php, executes SQL queries, runs content migrations, and misc utilities
> like cron or cache rebuild. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

Drush is used throughout Vortex to interact with Drupal from the workflow
scripts and Behat tests.

It also allows a developer to interact with the site via CLI during development.

While all the standard Drush commands supported, Vortex also provides some
shorthand commands to abstract some of the common tasks:

- downloading the database dump from the remote environment
- importing the database dump into the local environment
- running database updates and clearing caches

See [workflows](../../workflows) for more details.

## Usage

Drush should be used from the inside of the container.

```shell
docker compose exec cli drush <command>
```
or
```shell
ahoy drush <command>
```
