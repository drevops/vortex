# Drush

https://www.drush.org/

> Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush
> core ships with lots of useful commands and generators. Similarly, it runs
> update.php, executes SQL queries, runs content migrations, and misc utilities
> like cron or cache rebuild. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

Drush is used throughout **Vortex** to interact with Drupal from the automation
scripts and Behat tests.

It also allows a developer to interact with the site via CLI during development.

While all the standard Drush commands supported, **Vortex** also provides some
shorthand commands to abstract some of the common tasks:

- downloading the database dump from the remote environment
- importing the database dump into the local environment
- running database updates and clearing caches

➡️ See [Development](/docs/development)

## Usage

Drush should be used from the inside of the container.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy drush <command>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli drush <command>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## PHP runtime configuration

Vortex allows you to customize PHP runtime settings for Drush CLI commands
by editing the `drush/php-ini/drush.ini` file.

This file is auto-discovered via the `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` environment variable,
which is pre-configured in both the Docker CLI container and Acquia deployment
hooks.

For example, to increase the memory limit for Drush operations:

```ini
; drush/php-ini/drush.ini
memory_limit = 512M
```

Any valid PHP ini directive can be added to this file to adjust the runtime
behavior of Drush commands.

:::note

The leading colon in the `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` value preserves the default scan
directories. On Acquia, this ensures that the hosting provider's own PHP ini
overrides (such as `sendmail_path`) are not lost.

## Aliases

For Lagoon hosting, Drush site aliases are automatically generated for each
environment and can be used either from the host machine or from within the
container.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="host" label="Host" default>
    1. Make sure your SSH key is loaded in your `ssh-agent`:
    ```shell
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/path/to/key
    ```
    2. Run Drush commands using the Lagoon site aliases:
    ```shell
    drush @lagoon.develop status  # Show status of the develop environment
    drush @lagoon.pr-123 ssh      # SSH into the web container of the PR-123 environment
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy">
    1. Make sure your SSH key is loaded into `pygmy`:
    ```shell
    pygmy addkey --key ~/.ssh/path/to/key
    ```
    2. Run Drush commands using the Lagoon site aliases:
    ```shell
    ahoy drush @lagoon.develop status  # Show status of the develop environment
    ahoy drush @lagoon.pr-123 ssh      # SSH into the web container of the PR-123 environment
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    1. Make sure your SSH key is loaded into `pygmy`:
    ```shell
    pygmy addkey --key ~/.ssh/path/to/key
    ```
    2. Run Drush commands using the Lagoon site aliases:
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli drush drush @lagoon.develop status  # Show status of the develop environment
    docker compose exec cli drush drush @lagoon.pr-123 ssh      # SSH into the web container of the PR-123 environment
    ```
