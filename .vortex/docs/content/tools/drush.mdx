# Drush

https://www.drush.org/

> Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush
> core ships with lots of useful commands and generators. Similarly, it runs
> update.php, executes SQL queries, runs content migrations, and misc utilities
> like cron or cache rebuild. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

Drush is used throughout **Vortex** to interact with Drupal from the workflow
scripts and Behat tests.

It also allows a developer to interact with the site via CLI during development.

While all the standard Drush commands supported, **Vortex** also provides some
shorthand commands to abstract some of the common tasks:

- downloading the database dump from the remote environment
- importing the database dump into the local environment
- running database updates and clearing caches

See [workflows](/docs/workflows) for more details.

## Usage

Drush should be used from the inside of the container.

```shell
docker compose exec cli drush <command>
```

or

```shell
ahoy drush <command>
```
