# PHPStan - PHP Static Analysis Tool

https://phpstan.org/user-guide/getting-started

> PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code without actually running it. It
> catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code. It
> moves
> PHP closer to compiled languages in the sense that the correctness of each
> line
> of the code can be checked before you run the actual line.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured PHPStan ruleset](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/phpstan.neon)
for
Drupal projects.

## Usage

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy lint-be
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/phpstan
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

PHPStan does not fix code. It only reports errors. To fix errors, use
Rector.

➡️ See [Tools > Rector](rector.mdx)

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://phpstan.org/config-reference).

All global configuration takes place in
the [`phpstan.neon`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/phpstan.neon)
file.

By default, PHPStan will check with the Drupal context in mind thanks to
[mglaman/phpstan-drupal](https://github.com/mglaman/phpstan-drupal).

Targets include custom modules and themes, settings and tests.

Adding or removing targets:

```yaml
parameters:
  paths:
    - path/to/dir_or_file
  excludePaths:
    - path/to/exclude/all_dir_files/*
    - path/to/exclude/a_file.php
```

## Ignoring

Ignoring rules **globally** takes place in
the [`phpstan.neon`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/phpstan.neon) file:

```yaml
parameters:
  ignoreErrors:
    - # Comment about why this rules is excluded.
      # 'message' is a regular expression with `#` as begin and end delimiters.
      message: '#.*no value type specified in iterable type array.#'
      paths:
        - path/to/exclude/all_dir_files/*
        - path/to/exclude/a_file.php
```

PHPStan does not support ignoring of **all PHPStan rules** within a file.

PHPStan does not support ignoring of **a specific rule** within a file.

PHPStan [does not support](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/issues/4452)
ignoring of the **code blocks**.

To ignore only the current and the **next line**:

```php
// @phpstan-ignore-next-line
$a = 1;
```

## Ignoring fail in continuous integration pipeline

This tool runs in continuous integration pipeline by default and fails the build
if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_PHPSTAN_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
