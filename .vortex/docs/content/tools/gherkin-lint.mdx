# Gherkin Lint

https://github.com/dantleech/gherkin-lint-php

> Provides a Gherkin linter for PHP.

**Vortex** comes with [Gherkin Lint configuration](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/gherkinlint.json) for Behat tests.

## Usage

```shell
vendor/bin/gherkinlint lint tests/behat/features
```
or
```shell
ahoy lint-tests
```

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://github.com/dantleech/gherkin-lint-php?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) and [rules](https://github.com/dantleech/gherkin-lint-php/blob/master/docs/rules.md).

All global configuration takes place in the [`gherkinlint.json`](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/gherkinlint.json) file.
The values are merged with the default configuration.

To check enabled rules, run

```shell
vendor/bin/gherkinlint rules
```

## Ignoring

Ignoring rules **globally** takes place in the  [`gherkinlint.json`](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/gherkinlint.json) file.
```json
{
    "rules": {
        "filename": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
}
```

Gherkin Lint does not support ignoring of all rules in the file.

To ignore **a specific rule** within a file, place in the file header:
```yaml
# @gherkinlint-disable-rule keyword-order, someother-rule
```

Gherkin Lint does not support ignoring of the **code blocks**.

Gherkin Lint does not support ignoring rules on the **current line**.

Gherkin Lint does not support ignoring rules on the **next line**.

## Ignoring fail in CI

This tool runs in CI by default and fails the build if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_GHERKIN_LINT_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to
ignore failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
