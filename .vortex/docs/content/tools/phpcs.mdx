# PHPCS - PHP Code Sniffer

https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer

> PHP_CodeSniffer is a set of two PHP scripts; the main `phpcs` script that
> tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding
> standard, and a second `phpcbf` script to automatically correct coding standard
> violations. PHP_CodeSniffer is an essential development tool that ensures your
> code remains clean and consistent.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured PHPCS ruleset](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/phpcs.xml) for Drupal projects.

## Usage

### Check for violations

```shell
vendor/bin/phpcs
```

or

```shell
ahoy lint-be
```

### Fix violations

```shell
vendor/bin/phpcbf
```

or

```shell
ahoy lint-fix
```

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options).

All global configuration takes place in the [`phpcs.xml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/phpcs.xml) file.

By default, PHPCS will check against the following rules:

- `Drupal`
- `DrupalPractice`
- `Generic.Debug.ESLint`
- `PHPCompatibility`

Targets include custom modules and themes, settings and tests.

Adding or removing targets:

```xml
<file>path/to/dir_or_file</file>
```

Run checks against platform version specified in `composer.json` key `config.platform.php`:

```xml
<config name="testVersion" value="8.1"/>
```

## Ignoring

Ignoring rules **globally** takes place in the [`phpcs.xml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/phpcs.xml) file:

```xml
<!-- Comment about why this rules is excluded. -->
<rule ref="DrupalPractice.General.ClassName.ClassPrefix">
    <exclude-pattern>*\/dir\/another\/*\.php</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern>*\/dir\/another\/*\.inc</exclude-pattern>
</rule>
```

To ignore **all PHPCS rules** within a file, place in the file header:

```php
// phpcs:ignoreFile
```

To ignore **a specific rule** within a file, place in the file header:

```php
// phpcs:disable <rule_name>
```

To ignore rule for the **code block**:

```php
// phpcs:disable <rule_name>
$a = 1;
// phpcs:enable <rule_name>
```

To ignore only the current and the **next line**:

```php
// phpcs:ignore
$a = 1;
```

## Ignoring fail in continuous integration pipeline

This tool runs in continuous integration pipeline by default and fails the build
if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_PHPCS_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
