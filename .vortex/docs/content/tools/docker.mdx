Vortex provides a configuration for Docker and Docker Compose to run the
project in all environments using containers.

Special thanks to Lagoon for providing
the [container images](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-images)
that make this possible.

:::info

    Lagoon images are **production-grade** and are used in production environments.
    They receive regular updates and are maintained by the Lagoon team.

    If you are using Lagoon as your hosting provider, then all of your
    environments are using identical images to run the project.

## About Docker and Docker Compose

:::note

    Below is a brief overview of Docker and Docker Compose. For more information,
    see the official documentation.

:::

Docker is a technology that allows to define services such as a web server or
a database server as standalone _containers_, which are then run in an isolated
environment and can talk to each other.

The containers are started from _images_ - templates that define what is
installed
in the container and how it is configured. _Images_ allow to run _containers_
with consistent content and configuration.

Docker is an engine that runs containers, built from images, allowing them to
share host system resources and communicate to each other. When run locally,
Docker can be controlled with Docker CLI command, called `docker`.

Docker Compose is a tool that allows to define and run multi-container Docker
applications in a single `docker-compose.yml` file: multiple containers that
work together can be described in a single file, which makes it easier to
manage them.

When working with Drupal, which requires multiple service containers to run, a
developer would normally use Docker Compose CLI commands (rather than Docker CLI
commands) called `docker compose`. Note that this
commands runs in the context of the current directory, so it is important to
run them from the project root directory. This means that the issued commands
will only affect the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the
current directory and will not affect any other containers running on the host.

When a project is fully configured, the usage of Docker-based application comes
down to a handful of commands to manage the state of the containers (per
project):

- `docker compose up -d` - start the containers in the background.
- `docker compose down` - stop and remove the containers.
- `docker compose exec <service>` - run a command in a running `<service>`
  container.
- `docker compose logs -f` - follow the logs of all the containers.
- `docker compose ps` - list all running containers.

More advanced commands are normally used when adjusting the project Docker
configuration and services.

## Using Docker

Vortex uses Docker to run the project in a containerized environment locally
and in CI.

Some of the commands are wrapped in the Ahoy script as a shorthand. But all
the commands can be run directly using `docker compose` command.

Specific commands are described in the relevant [workflows](../../workflows)
sections.

## Understanding `docker-compose.yml`

Docker Compose reads the configuration from the `docker-compose.yml` and
`docker-compose.override.yml` files. The configuration files are written in
YAML, which [support anchors and references](http://blog.daemonl.com/2016/02/yaml.html)
that help to reduce duplication.

The file provided by Vortex contains the following sections:

- [Volumes definitions](#volumes-definitions)
- [Default user](#default-user)
- [Environment variables](#environment-variables)
- [Services](#services)
- [Networks](#networks)

### Volumes definitions

Volumes are used to share data between containers. If the host supports volume
mounting, then the data can be shared between containers through the host,
making it possible to access and modify the data from the host.

This is used during development to share the application code between the
container and the host, so that the changes made on the host are immediately
reflected in the running application.

There are 2 volumes defined:

- Project root directory `.` maps to `/app` directory within a container. This
  is where a PHP engine accesses the application code.
- Files directory `./web/sites/default/files` maps
  to `/app/web/sites/default/files` directory within a container as an override
  to the default volume definition. This allows to use different type of syncing
  to optimise performance, because files are not changed as often as the code.

There are 2 more volumes defined and commented out - these are used in
environments without volume mounting support, such as CircleCI. These volumes
definitions are automatically uncommented in CI environment, and they replace
the host volume mounting, which is removed.

`VOLUME_FLAGS` environment variable allows to define the consistency of the data
within mounted volumes. The values are:

- `default`: Equivalent to `consistent`.
- `consistent`: Full consistency. The container runtime and the host maintain an
  identical view of the mount at all times.
- `cached`: The host's view of the mount is authoritative. There may be delays
  before updates made on the host are visible within a container.
- `delegated`: The container runtime's view of the mount is authoritative. There
  may be delays before updates made in a container are visible on the host.

The default value is `delegated`, so that any changes done in the container are
immediately visible on the host.

### Default user

The default user is defined as `1000` - this is the user ID that is used in the
container to run the application. This is the same user ID as the host user, so
that the files created in the container are owned by the host user.

Changes this value if your user ID is different.

### Environment variables

By default, the Docker Composer reads environment variables from the `.env`
file. Vortex provides an additional capability to read files from `.env.local`
file as well. This allows to override the environment variables locally without
modifying the `.env` file.

The variables read from `.env` and `.env.local` files then passed into the
containers.

This section only defines 2 types of variables:

1. Variables that are specific to the stack and require a default value (
   like `LAGOON_ROUTE`).
2. Variables that cannot be stored in `.env` file and are injected from the
   actual environment (like secrets).

Any other variables should be defined in the `.env` file.

Consider the example:

```
  TZ: ${VORTEX_TZ:-Australia/Melbourne}
  # Local development URL.
  VORTEX_LOCALDEV_URL: &default-url ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-example-site}.docker.amazee.io
  # Local development route used in Lagoon images and Pygmy to route requests.
  LAGOON_ROUTE: *default-url
```

where

- `TZ: ${VORTEX_TZ:-Australia/Melbourne}` - defines a variable `TZ` with a
  default value of `Australia/Melbourne`, but only if `VORTEX_TZ` variable is
  not defined.
- `VORTEX_LOCALDEV_URL: &default-url ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-example-site}.docker.amazee.io`
  - defines a variable `VORTEX_LOCALDEV_URL` with a default value of
    `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-example-site}.docker.amazee.io`, but only if
    `VORTEX_LOCALDEV_URL` variable is not defined. The value of the variable
    is also stored in a YAML anchor `default-url` for later use.
- `LAGOON_ROUTE: *default-url` - defines a variable `LAGOON_ROUTE` with a value
  of `*default-url`, which is a reference to the `default-url` YAML anchor
  defined above.

See more information about environment variables in
the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/).

### Services

Services section describes the configuration for each container.

The following services are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file provided by
Vortex:

- `cli` - a container that runs a shell. This container is used to run commands
  in the context of the project, such as `composer` or `drush`. This is also a
  container where cron jobs are run within a hosting environment (if that
  environment supports containerisation).
- `nginx` - a container that runs a web server. This container is used to serve
  the application and pass requests to the PHP container.
- `php` - a container that runs a PHP engine. This container is used to run the
  application code and execute commands in the context of the application. It is
  different from the `cli` container in that it does not have certain
  development dependencies installed, has a smaller size and is optimised for
  scalability.
- `mariadb` - a container that runs a database server. This container is used to
  store the application data. It can be accessed from the host via a randomly
  assigned port - run `docker compose port mariadb 3306` to get the port number.
- `redis` - an optional container that runs a Redis server. This container is
  used to store the application cache.
- `solr` - an optional container that runs a Solr server. This container is used
  to store the application search index. It can be accessed from the host via a
  randomly assigned port - run `docker compose port solr 8983` to get the port
  number.
- `clamav` - an optional container that runs a ClamAV antivirus server. This
  container is used to scan uploaded files for viruses.
  - `chrome` - container that runs a Chrome browser. This container is
    used to run Behat tests. It is based on the official Selenium image which has
    additional required tools, like virtual desktop, installed.
- `wait_dependencies` - a container that runs a script to wait for applications
  within other containers to become available. Docker itself can coordinate
  startup of containers, but it does not know when the application within the
  container is ready to accept connections. This container is used to wait for
  specified application ports to become available. The whole stack is considered
  ready to be worked with only when this container exits with a zero exit code.

### Networks

Networks section defines the networks that are used to connect containers to
each other. [Pygmy](pygmy.mdx) provides the default `amazeeio-network` network
that
is used to connect all containers together.

## Validate `docker-compose.yml`

After updating the `docker-compose.yml` file, it is useful sometimes to validate
it before running the build. This can be done with the following command:

```bash

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config

```
