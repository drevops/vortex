**What `pygmy` will handle for you:**

- An HTTP reverse proxy for nice URLs and HTTPS offloading.
- A DNS system so we don't have to remember IP addresses.
- SSH agents to use SSH keys within containers.
- A system that receives and displays mail locally available at http://mailhog.docker.amazee.io/.
