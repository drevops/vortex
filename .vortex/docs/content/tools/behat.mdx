# Behat

https://docs.behat.org/en/latest/user_guide.html

> A php framework for auto-testing your business expectations.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured Behat profiles](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/behat.yml) for Drupal projects.

## Usage

Since Behat requires a running Drupal instance, it can only be run within
container environment.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-bdd
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec -T cli php -d memory_limit=-1 vendor/bin/behat
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running all tests in the file

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-bdd tests/behat/features/my.feature
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec -T cli vendor/bin/behat tests/behat/features/my.feature
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Running tagged tests with `@group_name` tag**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    ahoy test-bdd --tags=group_name
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    docker compose exec -T cli vendor/bin/behat --tags=group_name
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://docs.behat.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration.html).

All global configuration takes place in the [`behat.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/behat.yml) file.

By default, Behat will run all tests defined in `tests/behat/features` directory.

Adding or removing test targets:

```yml
default:
  suites:
    default:
      paths:
        - '%paths.base%/web/modules/custom/mymodule/tests/behat/features'
```

### Contexts and extensions

The configuration uses the following contexts and extensions:

- [Drupal Extension](https://github.com/jhedstrom/drupalextension): The Drupal Extension is an integration layer between Behat, Mink Extension, and Drupal. It provides step definitions for common testing scenarios specific to Drupal sites.
- [Behat Screenshot Extension](https://github.com/drevops/behat-screenshot): Behat extension and step definitions to create HTML and image screenshots on demand or when tests fail.
- [Behat Progress Fail Output Extension](https://github.com/drevops/behat-format-progress-fail): Behat output formatter to show progress as TAP and fails inline.
- [Behat Steps](https://github.com/drevops/behat-steps): Collection of Behat steps for Drupal

## Reports and screenshots

Behat is configured to generate test run reports in JUnit format stored in
`.logs/test_results/behat`.

Screenshots for failed tests or purposely made screenshots are stored in
`.logs/screenshots` directory.

Both test results and screenshots are stored as artifacts when run in continuous
integration pipelines.

### Profiles

Behat runs with `default` profile defined in the configuration file: this runs
all tests not tagged with `@skipped` tag.

There are also `p1` and `p2` profiles defined that run tests not tagged with
`@skipped` and tagged with `@p1` and `@p2` tags respectively. These profiles are
used in continuous integration pipeline to run tests in parallel if parallel
runners number is greater than `1`.
Behat will run tests using `@pX` tags on tests, where `X` is the runner index
starting from `0`.

In the example below, if there is one runner, Behat will run all scenarios, but
if there are 2 runners - Behat will run only scenarios with `@p0` tag on the
first runner and scenarios with `@p1` tag on the second runner.

```gherkin
@homepage @smoke
Feature: Homepage

  Ensure that homepage is displayed as expected.

  @api @p0
  Scenario: Anonymous user visits homepage
    Given I go to the homepage
    And I should be in the "<front>" path
    Then I save screenshot

  @api @javascript @p1
  Scenario: Anonymous user visits homepage
    Given I go to the homepage
    And I should be in the "<front>" path
    Then I save screenshot
```

The profile can be overridden using `$VORTEX_CI_BEHAT_PROFILE` environment
variable set in the continuous integration pipeline configuration.

## Writing tests

When writing tests, it is recommended to use the following structure:

```gherkin
@tag_describing_feature_group
Feature: Short feature description

  As a site owner
  I want to make sure that my feature does what it is supposed to do
  So that I can be sure that my site is working as expected

  @api
  Scenario: Anonymous user uses a feature
    Given I go to the homepage
    And I should be in the "<front>" path
    Then I save screenshot

  @api @javascript
  Scenario: Anonymous user uses a feature with AJAX
    Given I go to the homepage
    And I click ".button" element
    Then I save screenshot
```

Use `@api` tag for tests that do not require JavaScript and `@api @javascript`
for tests that require JavaScript.

:::tip

JavaScript tests are slow. Try using as few JavaScript tests as possible to
keep the test run time low.

### `FeatureContext.php`

The [`FeatureContext.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/behat/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php)
file is a Behat custom context file that is loaded by default. This is where
custom step definitions and hooks should be placed.

It is recommended to use traits to organize step definitions and hooks and
include those traits in the `FeatureContext.php` file. There are already
several traits included from the [Behat Steps](https://github.com/drevops/behat-steps)
package.

There are also example tests in the [`tests/behat/features`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/behat/features)
directory that can be used as a starting point for writing tests. These tests
define `@smoke` tests for the homepage and login page as well as tests for
contributed modules.

## Connecting to the browser

For `@javascript` tests, Behat uses Selenium to connect to the browser. The
browser runs within a container and can be observed from the host machine by
using a browser thanks to the VNC server running in the container and [noVNC](https://novnc.com/).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    1. Get the link for Selenium VNC URL on host:
    ```shell
    ahoy info
    ```
    2. Click on the link next to `Selenium VNC URL on host` to open the browser.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Docker Compose">
    1. Get the port number:
    ```shell
    docker compose port chrome 7900
    ```
    2. Replace `<port>` with the value above and open `http://localhost:<port>/?autoconnect=1&password=secret` in your browser.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

When running tests, you can add `And I wait for 60 seconds` step to suspend
the test execution for a minute and interact with the headless browser in a
container through a browser on your host machine.

## Ignoring fail in continuous integration pipeline

This tool runs in continuous integration pipeline by default and fails the build
if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_BEHAT_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.

:::note

Due to the size of your website and the available continuous integration runner
resources, Behat tests may occasionally fail.

To prevent the pipeline from failing as a result, any failed Behat test will be
retried automatically.
