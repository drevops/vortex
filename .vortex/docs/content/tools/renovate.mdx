# Renovate - Automated updates

Vortex uses [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) for automated dependency updates.

The configuration is stored in [`renovate.json`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/renovate.json). It is
based on [Renovate configuration for automated Drupal dependency updates](https://github.com/drevops/renovate-drupal)
project.

## Features

1. Dual schedules for Drupal package updates:
    - Daily update schedule for critical Drupal core and related packages created in
      the `deps/drupal-minor-patch-core` branch.
    - Weekly update schedule for all other packages created in
      the `deps/drupal-minor-patch-contrib` branch.
2. Container image updates in `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the `deps/docker` branch.
3. GitHub Actions updates in the `deps/github-actions` branch.
4. Automatically adds a `dependencies` label to a pull request.
5. Automatically adds assignees to a pull request.
6. Configuration for running Renovate self-hosted instance using CircleCI.

## Self-hosted vs GitHub app

Renovate can run as a hosted GitHub app or as a standalone self-hosted service
in CircleCI or GitHub Actions.

A self-hosted service can be beneficial when your project is restricted in terms
of third-party access.

**Note**: If the `RENOVATE_TOKEN` is not provided and the job is configured, the job will still run but the Renovate
update steps will be skipped gracefully without causing a build failure.

### Setting up Renovate self-hosted in CircleCI

Create a GitHub token with a permission to write to a repository and add it to
the environment variable in CircleCI UI as a `RENOVATE_TOKEN`.

To test the run without making any changes, create the `RENOVATE_DRY_RUN`
environment variable in CircleCI UI and set it to `true`.

To override the Git author, create the `RENOVATE_GIT_AUTHOR` environment
variable in CircleCI UI and set it to `Your name <your-user@your-server>`.

To enable the Renovate Dependency Dashboard, create the
`RENOVATE_DEPENDENCY_DASHBOARD` environment variable in CircleCI UI
and set it to `true`.
Note that triggering actions from the self-hosted service is not supported.

### Setting up Renovate self-hosted in GitHub Actions

Create a GitHub token with a permission to write to a repository and add it to
the repository secrets as a `RENOVATE_TOKEN`.

To test the run without making any changes, create the `RENOVATE_DRY_RUN`
environment variable in repository variables and set it to `true`.

To override the Git author, create the `RENOVATE_GIT_AUTHOR` environment
variable in repository variables and set it to `Your name <your-user@your-server>`.

To enable the Renovate Dependency Dashboard, create the
`RENOVATE_DEPENDENCY_DASHBOARD` environment variable in repository variables
and set it to `true`.
Note that triggering actions from the self-hosted service is not supported.
