# Renovate - Automated updates

**Vortex** uses [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) for automated dependency updates.

The configuration is stored in [`renovate.json`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/renovate.json). It is
based on [Renovate configuration for automated Drupal dependency updates](https://github.com/drevops/renovate-drupal)
project.

## Features

1. Dual schedules for Drupal package updates:
    - Daily update schedule for critical Drupal core and related packages created in
      the `deps/drupal-minor-patch-core` branch.
    - Weekly update schedule for all other packages created in
      the `deps/drupal-minor-patch-contrib` branch.
2. Container image updates in `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the `deps/docker` branch.
3. GitHub Actions updates in the `deps/github-actions` branch.
4. Automatically adds a `dependencies` label to a pull request.
5. Automatically adds assignees to a pull request.
6. Configuration for running Renovate self-hosted instance using CircleCI.
7. Manual trigger from GitHub Actions UI and CircleCI pipeline.
8. Debug logging enabled for detailed troubleshooting.

## Self-hosted vs GitHub app

Renovate can run as a hosted GitHub app or as a standalone self-hosted service
in CircleCI or GitHub Actions.

A self-hosted service can be beneficial when your project is restricted in terms
of third-party access.

**Note**: If the `RENOVATE_TOKEN` is not provided and the job is configured, the job will still run but the Renovate
update steps will be skipped gracefully without causing a build failure.

### Setting up Renovate self-hosted in CircleCI

#### Required environment variables

The following environment variables **must** be manually created in the CircleCI project settings:

1. `RENOVATE_TOKEN` (required): GitHub access token with repository write permissions
2. `RENOVATE_REPOSITORIES` (required): Repository to run Renovate on in format `yourorg/repo`
3. `RENOVATE_GIT_AUTHOR` (required): Author for Renovate commits in format `Name <email@example.com>` (e.g., `Renovate Bot <renovate@example.com>`)

#### Optional environment variables

These can be created to customize behavior (will use defaults if not set):

- `RENOVATE_DRY_RUN`: Set to `true` to test runs without making changes (default: `false`)
- `RENOVATE_DEPENDENCY_DASHBOARD`: Set to `true` to enable the dependency dashboard (default: `false`)

Note that triggering actions from the self-hosted service is not supported.

#### Manual trigger

The Renovate job in CircleCI can be triggered manually from the CircleCI pipeline UI.

#### Debug logging

Debug logging is enabled by default with `LOG_LEVEL: 'debug'` to provide detailed
information about the Renovate execution process. This helps with troubleshooting
dependency update issues and understanding why certain updates might be skipped.

### Setting up Renovate self-hosted in GitHub Actions

#### Required environment variables

The following **must** be manually created in the GitHub repository settings:

1. `RENOVATE_TOKEN` (required): GitHub access token with repository write permissions
   *Location: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets*
2. `RENOVATE_GIT_AUTHOR` (required): Author for Renovate commits in format `Name <email@example.com>` (e.g., `Renovate Bot <renovate@example.com>`)
   *Location: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository variables*

#### Optional environment variables

These can be created to customize behavior (will use defaults if not set):

- `RENOVATE_REPOSITORIES`: Repository to run Renovate on in format `yourorg/repo` (default: uses current repository)
- `RENOVATE_DRY_RUN`: Set to `true` to test runs without making changes (default: `false`)
- `RENOVATE_DEPENDENCY_DASHBOARD`: Set to `true` to enable the dependency dashboard (default: `false`)

Note that triggering actions from the self-hosted service is not supported.

#### Manual trigger

The Renovate job in GitHub Actions can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
in the GitHub repository UI using the workflow dispatch feature.

#### Debug logging

Debug logging is available and can be enabled by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment
variable to `debug` in the workflow configuration for detailed troubleshooting.

## Dependency Dashboard

The Renovate Dependency Dashboard is a GitHub issue that provides visibility into:
- Available dependency updates that are scheduled for later execution
- Updates that have been filtered out due to configuration rules
- Failed update attempts and their reasons

The dashboard is created with the title "RenovateBot Dependency Dashboard (self-hosted)"
when running in self-hosted mode. This dashboard is particularly useful for understanding
why certain updates might not be applied immediately due to scheduling constraints or
configuration rules.
