To ignore **all Hadolint rules** within a file, place in the file header:

```Dockerfile
# hadolint global ignore=DL3003,DL3006,SC1035
FROM ubuntu

RUN cd /tmp && echo "hello!"
```

## Ignoring fail in continuous integration pipeline

This tool runs in continuous integration pipeline by default and fails the build
if there are any violations.

Set `VORTEX_CI_HADOLINT_IGNORE_FAILURE` environment variable to `1` to ignore
failures. The tool will still run and report violations, if any.
