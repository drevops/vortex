# FAQs

## Why use Vortex instead of the Drupal Composer template?

The Drupal Composer template gives you a starting point, but you still need to
add everything else: CI pipelines, tooling, automations, deployment scripts,
hosting configurations, and documentation. Then you need to test that
everything works together correctly.

You also need to watch for _false negatives_ — faulty tests that pass silently
in CI but fail at release time, blocking your deployment.

And you need to maintain all of this across every project you run.

**Vortex** handles all of this out of the box. You can override anything in
your project while still receiving future updates. Your team gets centralized
documentation and consistent tooling across all projects.

## Can I use Vortex with an existing project?

Yes, you can install **Vortex** into your existing project. See
[Installation](installation#installing-vortex-into-an-existing-project).

## Can I keep my existing CI provider?

Yes, but you'll need to update your CI configuration to use **Vortex** automation
scripts.

## Can I keep my existing hosting?

Yes, but you'll need to update some deployment scripts to match your hosting
provider.

## Can I change things I don't like?

Yes, you can change anything you want. **Vortex** is a template, so you can
disable or remove any feature. Keep in mind that you'll need to maintain those
changes yourself going forward.

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/issues) to
discuss any of the decisions made in **Vortex**.

## Isn't this overkill for my project?

**Vortex** provides a full feature set to all projects, regardless of size. You
can simply opt-out of features you don't need when installing: the installer
provides an interactive prompt to select only the features you want.

If you're sure you don't need certain features, **Vortex** may not be the
right fit. That said, many developers have discovered useful tools and
approaches through **Vortex** that they chose to keep. It's worth trying.

## Isn't this too opinionated?

**Vortex** is opinionated where necessary to make everything work together.
You can customize many things, but some defaults exist to keep tools
compatible with each other.

If something seems unreasonably opinionated, we consider that a defect and would
be happy to fix it. Please share your feedback in the
[issue queue](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/issues).

## How hard is it to upgrade?

Run the update command to pull in the latest **Vortex** version. The command
updates the boilerplate code automatically. You then resolve any conflicts
manually — similar to merging changes between projects, but automated.

Any customizations your team made will also need manual resolution. This is a
trade-off between relying on an upgradable project template, where you have full
control, and a dependency package, where someone else has full control of the
code that drives your project.

:::note

We're exploring a hybrid approach: package distribution with the ability to
override scaffolded code.

## How easy is it to choose the features that I need?

**Vortex** provides an [installer](installation) that allows you to choose the features
that you need interactively.

It is usually used as a part of the project creation process.
