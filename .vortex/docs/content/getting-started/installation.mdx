# Installation

The installation process consists of installing the **Vortex** template
followed by setting up the integrations with the required services.

We automated the first part by providing an in interactive installer. The second
part is a manual process that requires you to follow the instructions provided
for each service.

## Installing Vortex into a new project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

2. Run the following command to install the **Vortex** template.
    ```shell title="Install using interactive prompts"
    curl -SsL https://install.drevops.com > install.php && php install.php
    ```

3. Run the following command to initialize Git repository and commit the initial
   project structure.
    ```shell title="Initialize git repository"
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub and push the initial commit to it.

## Installing Vortex into an existing project

The installer cannot predict the state of your project, so it is recommended to
initialise **Vortex** into a new directory and then merge the changes from
your existing project into the new one.

:::warning

    Make sure to back up your project before proceeding with the following steps.

:::

1. Create a temporary directory and copy all of the files, including hidden files,
   from your existing project into it.

2. Create a new branch in your existing project.

3. Remove all files except for `.git` directory.

4. Run the following command to install the **Vortex** template.
    ```shell title="Install using interactive prompts"
    curl -SsL https://install.drevops.com > install.php && php install.php
    ```

5. Commit the changes to the new branch.

6. Copy the files from the temporary directory back into the project directory,
overriding the files that were installed by **Vortex**. Git status will show
the changes between the **Vortex** files and your files.

7. Selectively choose which changes to keep and which to discard:

    - Potentially, you may want to remove the module and theme examples provided
      by **Vortex**.

    - `composer.json` would need to be merged manually, preserving **all**
      the entries from the **Vortex's** `composer.json`.

    - `composer.lock` would
      need to be removed and fully regenerated by running `composer install`.

8. Commit the changes to the new branch and push to remote.

## Setting up integrations

Depending on the services you are using, you will need to set up the
integrations with CI, Docker Hub, your hosting and other services.

Please refer to the following guides for more information:

- [CI](../ci)
- [Hosting](../hosting)
