# Installation

The installation process consists of installing the **Vortex** template into
your project's codebase, and then setting up the integrations with the required
services.

We automated the first part by providing an in interactive installer. The second
part is a manual process that requires you to follow the instructions provided
for each service (see relevant sections in the documentation).

## Installing Vortex into a new project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

2. Run the following command to install the **Vortex** template.

    ```shell title="Install using interactive prompts"
    curl -SsL https://www.vortextemplate.com/install > installer.php && php installer.php
    ```

    <AsciinemaPlayer
      src="/img/installer.json"
      poster="npt:0:1"
      autoPlay={false}
      loop={false}
      preload={true}
      controls={true}
      theme="asciinema"
    />

3. Run the following command to commit the initial project structure.

    ```shell title="Commit the initial project structure"
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub and push the initial commit to it.

## Installing Vortex into an existing project

The installer cannot predict the state of your project, so it is recommended to
initialize **Vortex** into a new directory and then merge the changes from
your existing project into the new one.

:::warning

Make sure to back up your project before proceeding with the following steps.

:::

1. Create a temporary directory and copy all of the files, including hidden files,
   from your existing project into it.

2. Create a new branch in your existing project.

3. Remove all files except for `.git` directory.

4. Run the following command to install the **Vortex** template.

    ```shell title="Install using interactive prompts"
    curl -SsL https://www.vortextemplate.com/install > installer.php && php installer.php
    ```

5. Commit the changes to the new branch.

6. Copy the files from the temporary directory back into the project directory,
overriding the files that were installed by **Vortex**. Git status will show
the changes between the **Vortex** files and your files.

7. Selectively choose which changes to keep and which to discard:

    - Potentially, you may want to remove the module and theme examples provided
      by **Vortex**.

    - `composer.json` would need to be merged manually, preserving **all**
      the entries from the **Vortex's** `composer.json`.

    - `composer.lock` would
      need to be removed and fully regenerated by running `composer install`.

8. Commit the changes to the new branch and push to remote.

## Updating Vortex

Head to [Updating Vortex](../workflows/updating-vortex) for detailed
instructions on how to update your project to the latest version of **Vortex**.

## Setting up integrations

Depending on the services you are using, you will need to set up the
integrations with your hosting provider, continuous integration provider,  and
other services.

Please refer to the following guides for more information:

- [Continuous Integration](../continuous-integration)
