# Installation

The installation process consists of installing the **Vortex** template into
your project's codebase, and then setting up the integrations with the required
services.

We automated the first part by providing an in interactive installer. The second
part is a manual process that requires you to follow the instructions provided
for each service (see relevant sections in the documentation).

## Installing Vortex into a new project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.

2. Run the following command to install the **Vortex** template.

    ```shell title="Install using interactive prompts"
    curl -SsL https://www.vortextemplate.com/install > installer.php && php installer.php
    ```

    <AsciinemaPlayer
      src="/img/installer.json"
      poster="npt:0:1"
      autoPlay={false}
      loop={false}
      preload={true}
      controls={true}
      theme="asciinema"
      terminalLineHeight={1.0}
    />

3. Run the following command to commit the initial project structure.

    ```shell title="Commit the initial project structure"
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub and push the initial commit to it.

## Installing Vortex into an existing project

The installer cannot predict the state of your project, so it is recommended to
initialize **Vortex** into a new directory and then merge the changes from
your existing project into the new one.

:::warning

Make sure to back up your project before proceeding with the following steps.

:::

1. Create a temporary directory and copy all of the files, including hidden files,
   from your existing project into it.

2. Create a new branch in your existing project.

3. Remove all files except for `.git` directory.

4. Run the following command to install the **Vortex** template.

    ```shell title="Install using interactive prompts"
    curl -SsL https://www.vortextemplate.com/install > installer.php && php installer.php
    ```

5. Commit the changes to the new branch.

6. Copy the files from the temporary directory back into the project directory,
overriding the files that were installed by **Vortex**. Git status will show
the changes between the **Vortex** files and your files.

7. Selectively choose which changes to keep and which to discard:

    - Potentially, you may want to remove the module and theme examples provided
      by **Vortex**.

    - `composer.json` would need to be merged manually, preserving **all**
      the entries from the **Vortex's** `composer.json`.

    - `composer.lock` would
      need to be removed and fully regenerated by running `composer install`.

8. Commit the changes to the new branch and push to remote.

## Updating Vortex

Head to [Updating Vortex](../workflows/updating-vortex) for detailed
instructions on how to update your project to the latest version of **Vortex**.

## Setting up integrations

Depending on the services you are using, you will need to set up the
integrations with your hosting provider, continuous integration provider,  and
other services.
