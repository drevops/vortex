## Why would I use **Vortex** instead of just using Drupal Composer template?

You can use Drupal Composer template, but that will be your step 1. Your next
step would be to add all the missing pieces that **Vortex** provides,
such as CI integrations, tooling configuration, workflows, deployment scripts,
hosting-specific configurations, documentation.

Then you would have to test all of that and make sure that it works correctly
together. You would also need to make sure that  there are no false positives
(for example, passing CI on broken tests can go unnoticed up until the release
and would block it).

And you would have to maintain all of that and apply the updates to all the
projects that you have (if you like things to be consistent, of course).

**Vortex** covers this out of the box: you can override anything
you want in your project, but still receive updates and improvements from
**Vortex** in the future. Your team will also have a central place to
look for the documentation and the tools that they need to use.

## Can I use **Vortex** with my existing project?

Yes, you can install **Vortex** into your existing project.

## Can I use **Vortex** with my existing project and keep my existing CI?

Yes, but you would need to update your CI configuration to use **Vortex**'s
workflow scripts.

## Can I use **Vortex** with my existing project and keep my existing hosting?

Yes, but you would need to update some of the deployment scripts to match your
hosting provider.

## I do not like some of the decisions made in **Vortex**. Can I make changes?

Yes, you can change anything you want. **Vortex** is a project template,
which means that you can disable/remove certain features. But it also means that
you may need to maintain these changes in the future yourself.

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/issues) to
discuss any of the decisions made in **Vortex**.

## I do not need all these features? It looks like an overkill.

One of the core principles of **Vortex** is to provide
rich features to all projects, regardless of their size.

If you think that some of the features are not required for your project, then
**Vortex** is not for you. However, there were cases when people have
discovered some new tools and approaches by using **Vortex** and have
decided to keep them in their projects. So, you may want to give it a try.

:::note

    We are working on providing a more streamlined way of choosing the features
    during the project creation process, so you could reduce the number of
    features to the minimum required for your project.

:::

## I think it is too opinionated.

**Vortex** is opinionated to the point to make it work as a project
template. There are some changes that you can make to the project, but there
are also some that have to stay in order to make tools "talk" to each other.

There could be some cases when it is unreasonably opinionated - we consider this
as a defect and would be happy to fix it. Please provide your feedback in the
[issue queue](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/issues).

## How easy is it to upgrade **Vortex** in my project?

We provide a command to update **Vortex** to the latest version. When it
runs, it will update the scaffolded code to the latest version. You would then
need to manually resolve any conflicts that may arise. This process is similar
to how developers manually copying the changes from one project to another, but
in this case, it is automated.

Also, any changes and adjustments made by your team for your project would need
to be manually resolved. This is a trade-off between relying on an upgradable
project template, where you have full control, and a dependency package, where
someone else has full control of the code that drives your project.

:::note

    We are looking at utilising the approach from both worlds: distribution
    through a package with an ability to override the scaffolded code.

:::

## How easy is it choose the features that I need?

**Vortex** provides an installer that allows you to choose the features
that you need interactively.

It is usually used as a part of the project creation process.

:::note

    We are working on providing a more robust installer and a web-UI version.

## Why CircleCI? What about other CI providers?

CircleCI was chosen because of its flexibility. More specifically, CircleCI
allows to use your own runner container (the container where CI steps run) and
use remote Docker, making it possible to build the project in CI **exactly** the
same way as it would be built in your hosting (if your hosting uses Docker).

The other reason is that CircleCI supports passing the build artifacts between
jobs via cache. This becomes really powerful on large consumer sites, where
building the project takes a long time. **Vortex** mitigates this by
providing a [CI configuration](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml)
used to download and cache the database overnight and use this cache for all
the builds during the day, skipping the long database download and import
process.

And for the really large projects, CircleCI supports container image layer
caching, meaning that some parts of the application could be built once and then
reused in all the subsequent builds.
