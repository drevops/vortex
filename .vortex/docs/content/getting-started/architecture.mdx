# Architecture

**Vortex** is a production-ready Drupal project template designed to simplify
onboarding, unify workflows, and ensure long-term maintainability.

This page provides a high-level overview of how the template is structured, how
its components work together, and how your project benefits from its
architecture.

## Design Principles

**Vortex** is guided by principles that prioritize simplicity, visibility, and
maintainability:

- **Simple is better than complex**: The template encourages clarity, even in
  customizations.
- **Use standard tools**: Wherever possible, **Vortex** follows upstream conventions
  and avoids reinvention.
- **Avoid silent errors**: Misconfigurations should fail loudly.
- **Readability counts**: Code and configuration are meant to be understood.
- **Explicit logging helps**: Scripts log every major step, so it’s easy to
  follow what’s going on.

## System Components

The system is made up of several modular pieces that work together:

- Local development environment
- Drupal management
- Code quality and testing tools
- Continuous integration workflows
- Hosting provider configurations
- Automated dependency updates
- Project documentation
- Workflow scripts to connect components

You can see how these parts connect in the diagram below:

## Local Development Environment

Your project includes a containerized local environment using Docker Compose and
production-grade Lagoon images. This ensures consistency between local, CI, and
hosting environments.

To simplify command usage, we use [Ahoy](https://ahoy-cli.dev/) as a wrapper. It
lets you run complex workflows like provisioning, testing, or database imports
with short, easy-to-remember commands.

## Drupal management

### Provisioning

The provisioning process is central to how **Vortex** works. Instead of manually
running Drush commands, you run a single provision script. This script handles:

- Importing a database (or initializing from a profile)
- Running updates, config imports, cache rebuilds, and deploy hooks
- Executing post-provision custom scripts

Because provisioning is centralized, it runs exactly in the same way in every
environment: local, CI, or hosting. This eliminates "works on my machine"
problems and makes the process predictable for everyone.

➡️ See [Drupal > Provision](../drupal/provision)

### Module and Theme Scaffolds

We include examples of a custom module and theme, each fully integrated with
tests. These show you how to:

- Structure custom features
- Write functional, kernel, and unit tests
- Connect theme assets to a build pipeline

Use these scaffolds as starting points for your own work.

➡️ See [Drupal > Module Scaffold](../drupal/module-scaffold)
and [Drupal > Theme Scaffold](../drupal/theme-scaffold)

### Settings Management

**Vortex** includes a structured way to manage Drupal settings per environment.
Here's how it works:

- The environment type (e.g. local, CI, stage) is automatically detected based
  on your hosting provider.
- Configuration overrides are stored in `includes/modules/` with logic per
  environment inside each module-specific file.

This structure gives you clarity, avoids config sprawl, and lets you remove a
module’s settings cleanly when no longer needed.

➡️ See [Drupal > Settings](../drupal/settings)

## Code Quality and Testing

**Vortex** ships with pre-configured tools for maintaining code quality:

- **PHP CodeSniffer (phpcs)**
- **PHPStan**
- **PHP Mess Detector (phpmd)**
- **Twig CS Fixer**

You’ll also find scaffolds for:

- **PHPUnit**: Unit and kernel testing
- **Behat**: Behavior-driven testing with screenshot capture and extra steps

➡️ See [Tools > PHPStan](../tools/phpstan), [Tools > PHPCS](../tools/phpcs),
[Tools > Behat](../tools/behat), and [Tools > PHPUnit](../tools/phpunit)

## Continuous Integration Workflows

**Vortex** supports GitHub Actions and CircleCI. You choose which one to use in your
project. The workflows include:

- Database download and caching (for faster builds)
- Full site provisioning in CI
- Running code quality checks
- Running unit, functional and behavior tests
- Triggering deploys when tests pass

Each continuous integration configuration mirrors what happens locally and in hosting to ensure
uniformity.

➡️ See [Continuous Integration](../continuous-integration)

## Hosting Integrations

Out of the box, **Vortex** supports Acquia and Lagoon hosting. These integrations:

- Trigger provisioning with the same steps used locally and in CI
- Provide deployment workflows suited to each platform

You can use **Vortex** with other platforms too, but these are first-class
integrations.

➡️ See [Hosting](../hosting)

## Automated Dependency Updates

**Vortex** includes configuration for RenovateBot to automate dependency upgrades:

- Critical updates checked daily
- Regular updates run weekly
- PRs include changelogs and pass through your continuous integration pipeline

You can host RenovateBot yourself or use the cloud version, and you can tweak
the schedule as needed.

➡️ See [Tools > Renovate](../tools/renovate)

## Documentation & Onboarding

**Vortex** includes centralized documentation (what you’re reading now), as well as
a scaffold for adding project-specific docs within your own repository.

## Workflow Scripts

A workflow is a sequence of steps to achieve a goal. In **Vortex**, those are
defined via POSIX-compliant Bash scripts in `scripts/vortex`.

These scripts:

- Run identically across local, CI, and hosting
- Support environment variables to adapt behavior
- Are modular and easy to extend

### Customizing workflows

All scripts support configuration via environment variables, allowing workflows
to be easily adapted to specific project or environment needs.

During initial project setup, `.env` file is updated with project-specific
values like project name, email etc. Then, environment variables (secrets,
tokens, etc.) are set in CI or hosting environments.

Refer to the [Workflows](../workflows) section for more details.

### Router scripts

Most ****Vortex**** commands are implemented as router scripts entry points like
`download-db.sh` or `deploy.sh—that` dynamically invoke a more specific logic
for your setup, based on configuration or environment variables.

For example:

- `download-db.sh` is a router script that downloads a database from any
  supported hosting provider or custom location without needing to know the
  specifics of each provider.
- `deploy.sh` is a router script that deploys code to any hosting provider in a
  consistent manner, regardless of whether it's Acquia, Lagoon, or another
  platform.
