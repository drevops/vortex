# Authoring scripts

## Requirements

:::note

    Please refer to [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) for meaning of words `MUST`, `SHOULD` and `MAY`.

:::

1. MUST adhere to [POSIX standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX).
2. MUST pass Shellcheck code analysis scan
3. MUST start with:
```bash
 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 ##
 # Action description that the script performs.
 #
 # More description and usage information with a last empty
 # comment line.
 #

 set -eu
 [ "${VORTEX_DEBUG-}" = "1" ] && set -x
```
4. MUST list all variables with their default values and descriptions. i.e.:
```bash
# Deployment reference, such as a git SHA.
VORTEX_NOTIFY_REF="${VORTEX_NOTIFY_REF:-}"
```
5. MUST include a delimiter between variables and the script body preceded and
   followed by an empty line (3 lines in total):
```bash
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
6. SHOULD include formatting helper functions:
```bash
# @formatter:off
note() { printf "       %s\n" "${1}"; }
info() { [ "${TERM:-}" != "dumb" ] && tput colors >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf "\033[34m[INFO] %s\033[0m\n" "${1}" || printf "[INFO] %s\n" "${1}"; }
pass() { [ "${TERM:-}" != "dumb" ] && tput colors >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf "\033[32m[ OK ] %s\033[0m\n" "${1}" || printf "[ OK ] %s\n" "${1}"; }
fail() { [ "${TERM:-}" != "dumb" ] && tput colors >/dev/null 2>&1 && printf "\033[31m[FAIL] %s\033[0m\n" "${1}" || printf "[FAIL] %s\n" "${1}"; }
# @formatter:on
```
7. SHOULD include variable values checks with errors and early exist, i.e.:
```bash
[ -z "${VORTEX_NOTIFY_REF}" ] && fail "Missing required value for VORTEX_NOTIFY_REF" && exit 1
```
8. SHOULD include binaries checks if the script relies on them, i.e.:
```bash
command -v curl > /dev/null || ( fail "curl command is not available." && exit 1 )
```
9. MUST contain an `info` message about the start of the script body, e.g.:
```bash
info "Started GitHub notification for operation ${VORTEX_NOTIFY_EVENT}"
```
10. MUST contain an `pass` message about the finish of the script body, e.g.:
```bash
pass "Finished GitHub notification for operation ${VORTEX_NOTIFY_EVENT}"
```
11. MUST use uppercase global variables
12. MUST use lowercase local variables.
13. MUST use long options instead of short options for readability. I.e., `drush cache:rebuild` instead of `drush cr`.
14. MUST use `VORTEX_` prefix for variables, unless it is a known 3-rd party
    variable like `PACKAGE_TOKEN` or `COMPOSER`.
15. MUST use script-specific prefix. I.e., for `notify.sh`, the variable to skip
    notifications should start with `VORTEX_NOTIFY_`.
16. MAY rely on variables from the external scripts (not prefixed with a
    script-specific prefix), but MUST declare such variables in the header of
    the file.
17. MAY call other **Vortex** scripts (discouraged), but MUST source them rather
    than creating a sub-process. This is to allow passing environment variables
    down the call stack.
18. SHOULD use `note` messages for informing about the script progress.
19. MUST use variables in the form of `${VAR}`.


## Variables

Follow these guidelines when creating or updating **Vortex** variables.

1. Local variables MUST be in lowercase, and global variables MUST be in
   uppercase.

2. All **Vortex** variables MUST start with `VORTEX_` to separate **Vortex** from
   third-party variables.

3. Global variables MAY be re-used as-is across scripts. For instance, the
   `WEBROOT` variable is used in several scripts.

4. **Vortex** action-specific script variables MUST be scoped within their own
   script. For instance, the `VORTEX_PROVISION_OVERRIDE_DB`
   variable in the `provision.sh`.

5. Drupal-related variables SHOULD start with `DRUPAL_` and SHOULD have a module
   name added as a second prefix. This is to separate **Vortex**,
   third-party services variables, and Drupal variables. For instance, to set
   a user for Drupal's Shield module configuration, use `DRUPAL_SHIELD_USER`.

6. Variables SHOULD NOT be exported into the global scope unless absolutely
   necessary. Thus, values in `.env` SHOULD have default values set, but SHOULD
   be commented out to provide visibility and avoid exposure to the global scope.

## Boilerplate script

Use the boilerplate script below to kick-start your custom **Vortex** script.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!./script-boilerplate.sh';

<CodeBlock language="bash">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
