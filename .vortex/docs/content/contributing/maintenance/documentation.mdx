# Authoring documentation

There are 2 types of the documentation that **Vortex** provides:

1. This Documentation of **Vortex** that is then deployed
   to https://vortex.drevops.com/
2. Consumer site documentation that is distributed when **Vortex** is
   installed.

## vortex.drevops.com

The Documentation (this site) is written in Markdown and located in
[`.vortex/docs`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/.vortex/docs) directory. This is
removed when you install **Vortex** for a
consumer site.

### Local build

```bash
cd .vortex/docs
ahoy build
```

Parts of the documentation is generated automatically from the codebase.
To update it, run:

```bash
cd .vortex
ahoy update-docs
```

If you have the documentation site running locally, the content changes will
be available immediately.

### Check spelling and links

```bash
cd .vortex
ahoy test-docs
```

If required, add spelling exclusions to `.vortex/docs/cspell.json`
file.

### Publishing

An automated continuous integration build publishes this documentation.

- on tag, publishes to https://vortex.drevops.com/
- on every commit to a branch that contains `release-docs` string publishes to https://vortex.drevops.com/
- on every push to `develop`, publishes to development version of documentation https://vortex-docs.netlify.app
- on every push or tag, publishes to the temporary version of documentation with a link added to the PR as a comment.

## Consumer site documentation

**Vortex** provides a scaffold of the consumer site documentation in the
[`docs`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/docs) directory.

After **Vortex** is installed into the consumer site, these docs are
intended to be used by the site maintainers and stay up-to-date with the
project changes.
