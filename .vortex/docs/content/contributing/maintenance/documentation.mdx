# Authoring documentation

There are 2 types of the documentation that **Vortex** provides:

1. **Vortex template documentation** (this site) - Generic information on
   **how** to perform operations, applicable to all projects built with Vortex.
   Deployed to https://www.vortextemplate.com/docs/
2. **Per-project documentation** - Project-specific information on **what** the
   project does, distributed in the `docs/` directory when Vortex is installed.

The key relationship: per-project documentation describes **what** (coding
standards, testing requirements, release configuration) while referencing the
Vortex documentation for **how** to perform specific operations.

## www.vortextemplate.com

This documentation provides generic "how-to" guides suitable for any project
using the Vortex template. It covers tooling, automation, and operations that
are common across all Vortex-based projects.

The source is written in Markdown and located in
[`.vortex/docs`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/.vortex/docs)
directory. This is removed when you install **Vortex** for a consumer site.

### Local build

```shell
cd .vortex/docs
ahoy build
```

Parts of the documentation are generated automatically from the codebase.
To update it, run:

```shell
cd .vortex
ahoy update-docs
```

If you have the documentation site running locally, the content changes will
be available immediately.

### Check spelling and links

```shell
cd .vortex
ahoy test-docs
```

If required, add spelling exclusions to `.vortex/docs/cspell.json`
file.

### Publishing

An automated continuous integration build publishes this documentation.

- on tag, publishes to https://www.vortextemplate.com/docs/
- on every commit to a branch that contains `release-docs` string publishes to https://www.vortextemplate.com/docs/
- on every push to `develop`, publishes to development version of documentation https://vortex-docs.netlify.app
- on every push or tag, publishes to the temporary version of documentation with a link added to the PR as a comment.

## Consumer site documentation

**Vortex** provides a scaffold of the consumer site documentation in the
[`docs`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/docs) directory.

After **Vortex** is installed into the consumer site, these docs are
intended to be used by the site maintainers and stay up-to-date with the
project changes.

This documentation describes the **what** for the project:

- Coding standards and agreements specific to the project
- Testing requirements and configuration
- Release and deployment configuration
- Project-specific procedures and decisions

When describing **how** to perform an operation, per-project documentation
should reference the relevant page on https://www.vortextemplate.com/docs/
rather than duplicating instructions. This keeps project docs focused on
decisions and configuration while leveraging the maintained Vortex
documentation for operational details.
