# Contributing

**Vortex** is an open source project. There are numerous ways to
contribute to **Vortex** whether youâ€™re a developer or a non-technical
user.

## What forms of contribution are we looking for?

Any form of contribution to **Vortex**, be it rectifying a bug, proposing
a new feature, or enhancing our documentation, is highly appreciated. We are
glad for your willingness to assist!

## I've discovered a problem

We're constantly eager to address any issues, so your reports are always
appreciated. However, we kindly ask you to first check if your problem has
already been reported in the [issue queue](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/issues).

## I want to suggest a feature or an idea

Fantastic! Please [submit your idea](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/issues)
and we'll gladly review it. While we can't promise every suggestion will be
implemented, we are always keen to hear innovative ideas for enhancing
the **Vortex**.

## Talk to us on Slack

Another good way is also to talk to us via `#drevops` Slack about your idea.
