# Development

## Typical development workflow

1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
2. Fetch the latest database dump from the production environment with `ahoy fetch-db`.
3. Build the project with `ahoy build`.
4. Start a new feature or bugfix branch:
    - Create a new branch from `develop`.
    - Implement the feature or fix the bug.
5. Run tests:
    - Run automated tests locally.
    - Fix any failing tests.
6. Run code quality checks:
    - Run static code analysis locally.
    - Fix any issues reported.
7. Commit changes to the branch and push it to the remote repository.
8. Create a pull request:
    - Create a pull request from the branch to `develop`.
    - Assign reviewers.
    - Wait for the continuous integration pipeline to pass.

## Switching branches

When switching to a new branch, there is no need to run `ahoy build` again as
it may take a long time to rebuild the entire project. Instead, you can
run these commands as needed based on what changed:

```bash
# Update Composer dependencies (if composer.json/composer.lock changed)
ahoy composer install

# Rebuild frontend assets (if theme files changed)
ahoy fe

# Provision site (if database or configuration changes expected)
ahoy provision
```

## Fetching database

To fetch the database with the latest data from the production environment,
use the `ahoy fetch-db` command, which will download the latest database
dump from the production environment into a `.data` directory.

:::note

The database dump is stored in the `.data` directory instead of being directly
imported into the local environment to allow for caching and reusing the
database dump without needing to download it every time you need to refresh
the local environment.

You can also manually download the database dump from the production environment
and place it in the `.data` directory.

:::

## Refreshing database

Use `ahoy provision` to import the database dump into the local environment
and run all the necessary updates. Run this command any time you need to
reset the local environment to the database dump stored in `.data`.

Alternatively, you could use the `ahoy import-db` command (instead of
`ahoy provision`) to import the database dump without running any updates. This
is useful if you want to quickly reset the database without applying any updates
or changes.

You can also export timestamped database dumps from the local environment into
`.data` directory using the `ahoy export-db` command. You can then use these
dumps to restore the local environment to a specific state: rename the dump
file to `.data/db.sql` and run `ahoy import-db`.

See [Drupal > Provision](../drupal/provision) for more details.

## Environment Variable Updates

To update environment variables in your local development environment:

1. Edit variables in `.env.local` file
2. Apply changes by restarting containers:
   ```bash
   ahoy restart
   ```

For more comprehensive variable reference, see [Variables](variables.mdx).

## Debugging with Xdebug

To enable Xdebug for debugging:

```bash
ahoy debug-on  # Enable Xdebug
ahoy up        # Disable Xdebug
```

For complete Xdebug setup and IDE configuration, see [Tools > Xdebug](../tools/xdebug.mdx).

## Working with Composer packages

### Installing

To install packages, use `composer require` to include the package and resolve dependencies.

```bash
composer require drupal/devel
```

By default, stable releases are installed. If you need a non-stable version (e.g., `alpha`, `beta`, `RC`), specify the version constraint explicitly:

```bash
composer require drupal/devel:^1.0.0@beta
```

Make sure that the `minimum-stability` setting in `composer.json` is set to
the version constraint you need. For example, to allow `alpha`, `beta`, and `RC` versions:

```json
{
    "minimum-stability": "beta"
}
```

### Adding JavaScript/CSS Libraries (npm packages)

To install JavaScript or CSS libraries as Drupal libraries with Composer,
they must be defined as [inline Composer packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#repositories).

1. Define the package in `composer.json` under the `repositories` section:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
         {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "gdsmith/jquery.easing",
                "type": "drupal-library",
                "version": "1.4.1",
                "source": {
                    "type": "git",
                    "url": "https://github.com/gdsmith/jquery.easing",
                    "reference": "1.4.1"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Require the package using Composer:

```bash
composer require gdsmith/jquery.easing
```

### Updating

To update all dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

:::tip Updates and patches

If your project uses [patches](#patching) to modify dependencies, the update
may fail if the patches are not compatible with the new versions of the
dependencies.

A common solution is to remove the patches temporarily, run the update, and then
reapply the patches one by one.
:::


To update a specific package and its dependencies:

```bash
composer update vendor/package-name --with-dependencies
```

For updating Drupal core, use:

```bash
composer update "drupal/core-*" --with-dependencies
```

After updating core, review changes with `git diff`, especially modified scaffolding files like `.htaccess`, and commit them in a single commit.

### Overriding paths

To override package installation paths, modify `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
            "web/libraries/chosen": [
                "npm-asset/chosen-js"
            ],
            "web/libraries/{$name}": [
                "type:drupal-library",
                "type:npm-asset",
                "type:bower-asset"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Patching

If you need to apply patches to included dependencies, use the `composer-patches` plugin. Add the patch definition in `composer.json` under the `extra.patches` section:

```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

Run `composer update drupal/foobar` after adding patches to apply them.

## Resetting the codebase

To reset the local environment, use the `ahoy reset` command. This command will
stop and remove all containers and downloaded dependency packages (`vendor`,
`node_modules` etc.).

To fully reset the repository to a state as if it was just cloned,
use the `ahoy reset hard` command.
