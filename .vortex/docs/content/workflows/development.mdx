# Development

## Typical development workflow

1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
2. Build the project with `ahoy build`.
3. Start a new feature or bugfix:
    - Create a new branch from `develop`.
    - Implement the feature or fix the bug.
4. Run tests:
    - Run automated tests locally.
    - Fix any failing tests.
5. Run code quality checks:
    - Run static code analysis locally.
    - Fix any issues reported.
6. Commit changes to the branch and push it to the remote repository.
7. Create a pull request:
    - Create a pull request from the branch to `develop`.
    - Assign reviewers.
    - Wait for the CI pipeline to pass.

## Refreshing database

To refresh the database with the latest data from the production environment,
use the `ahoy fetch-db` command, which will download the latest database
dump from the production environment into a `.data` directory.

Use `ahoy provision` to import the database dump into the local environment
and run all the necessary updates. Run this command any time you need to
reset the local environment to the database dump stored in `.data`.

**Vortex** deliberately stores the database dump in the `.data` directory
to locally cache the database dump and avoid downloading it every time a new
database import is needed.

## Working with Composer packages

### Installing

To install packages, use `composer require` to include the package and resolve dependencies.

```bash
composer require drupal/devel
```

By default, stable releases are installed. If you need a non-stable version (e.g., `alpha`, `beta`, `RC`), specify the version constraint explicitly:

```bash
composer require drupal/devel:^1.0.0@beta
```

Make sure that the `minimum-stability` setting in `composer.json` is set to
the version constraint you need. For example, to allow `alpha`, `beta`, and `RC` versions:

```json
{
    "minimum-stability": "beta"
}
```

### Updating

To update all dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

To update a specific package and its dependencies:

```bash
composer update vendor/package-name --with-dependencies
```

For updating Drupal core, use:

```bash
composer update "drupal/core-*" --with-dependencies
```

After updating core, review changes with `git diff`, especially modified scaffolding files like `.htaccess`, and commit them in a single commit.

### Overriding paths

To override package installation paths, modify `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
            "web/libraries/chosen": [
                "npm-asset/chosen-js"
            ],
            "web/libraries/{$name}": [
                "type:drupal-library",
                "type:npm-asset",
                "type:bower-asset"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Patching

If you need to apply patches to included dependencies, use the `composer-patches` plugin. Add the patch definition in `composer.json` under the `extra.patches` section:

```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```

Run `composer update drupal/foobar` after adding patches to apply them.

## Resetting the codebase

To reset the local environment, use the `ahoy reset` command. This command will
remove all downloaded dependencies packages.

To fully reset the repository to a state as if it was just cloned,
use the `ahoy reset hard` command.
