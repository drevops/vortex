# Testing

**Vortex** supports running Unit, Kernel, Functional, and BDD tests.

For local development, the tests can be run directly or using handy Ahoy
commands:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Direct" default>
    ```shell
    vendor/bin/phpunit                           # Run Unit, Kernel and Functional tests

    vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=unit          # Run Unit tests

    vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=kernel        # Run Kernel tests

    vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=functional    # Run Functional tests

    vendor/bin/behat                             # Run BDD tests
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Ahoy">
    ```shell
    ahoy test               # Run Unit, Kernel and Functional tests

    ahoy test-unit          # Run Unit tests

    ahoy test-kernel        # Run Kernel tests

    ahoy test-functional    # Run Functional tests

    ahoy test-bdd           # Run BDD tests
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In CI, tests are run by calling the test binaries directly.

## Unit testing

**Vortex** uses PHPUnit as a framework for Unit testing.

It is configured to use a copy of Drupal core's `core/phpunit.xml.dist`
configuration file to allow customizing the test suite per project.

### Reporting

Test reports are stored in `.logs/phpunit` directory
separated into multiple files and named after the suite name.
These reports are usually used in CI to track tests performance and stability.

### Boilerplate

**Vortex** provides Unit, Kernel and Functional tests boilerplate for custom [modules](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/modules/custom/ys_base/tests/src),
[themes](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/themes/custom/your_site_theme/tests/src) and
[scripts](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/phpunit).

These boilerplate tests run in CI when you install **Vortex** and can be used as
a starting point for writing your own.

#### Drupal settings tests

**Vortex** provides [Drupal settings tests](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/phpunit/Drupal/DrupalSettingsTest.php)
to check that Drupal settings are correct based on the environment type the site
is running: with the number of custom modules multiplied by the number of
environment types, it is easy to miss certain settings which may lead to
unexpected issues when deploying a project to a different environment.

It is intended to be used in your site and kept up-to-date with the
changes made to the `settings.php` file.

#### CI configuration tests

**Vortex** provides a [CI configuration tests](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/phpunit/CircleCiConfigTest.php)
to check that the CI configuration is correct. It is intended to be used in your
site and kept up-to-date with the CI configurations.

For example, there are tests for regular expressions used to filter the branches
and tags before they are deployed to the hosting environment.

## BDD testing

**Vortex** uses [Behat](https://behat.org) for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
testing. Behat allows to write human-readable stories that describe the behavior
of the application. Behat tests primarily focus on critical user journeys,
serving as comprehensive end-to-end validations.

**Vortex** provides full Behat support, including configuration in [`behat.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/behat.yml)
and a [browser container](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml) to run tests interactively in a real browser with
a VNC viewer.

Additional features include:

1. [Behat Drupal Extension](https://github.com/drupalprojects/drupalextension) - an extension to work with Drupal.
2. [Behat steps](https://github.com/drevops/behat-steps) - a library of re-usable Behat steps.
2. [Behat Screenshot](https://github.com/drevops/behat-screenshot) - extension to capture screenshots on-demand and on failure.
3. [Behat Progress formatter](https://github.com/drevops/behat-format-progress-fail) - extension to show progress as TAP and failures inline.
4. Parallel profiles - configuration to allow running tests in parallel.

### FeatureContext

The [`FeatureContext.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/behat/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php) file comes with
included steps from [Behat steps](https://github.com/drevops/behat-steps) package.

You can add your custom steps into this file.

### Profiles

Behat's `default` profile configured with sensible defaults to allow running it
with provided extensions.

In CI, the profile can be overridden using `$VORTEX_CI_BEHAT_PROFILE`
environment variable.

### Parallel runs

In CI, Behat tests can run within multiple runners to increase the speed of the
test suite. To achieve this, Behat tags are used to mark features and scenarios
with `@p*` tags.

Out of the box, **Vortex** provides support for unlimited parallel
runners, but only 2 parallel profiles `p0` and `p1`: a feature can be tagged by
either `@p0` or `@p1` to run in a dedicated runner, or with both tags to run in
both runners.

Note that you can easily add more `p*` profiles in your `behat.yml` by copying
existing `p1` profile and changing several lines of configuration.

Features without `@p*` tags will always run in the first CI runner, so even
if you forget to tag the feature, it will still be allocated to a runner.

If CI has only one runner - a `default` profile will be used and all tests
(except for those that tagged with `@skipped`) will be run.

### Skipping tests

Add `@skipped` tag to a feature or scenario to exclude it from the test run.

### Screenshots

Test screenshots are stored into `.logs/screenshots` location by default,
which can be overwritten using `$BEHAT_SCREENSHOT_DIR` variable (courtesy of
[Behat Screenshot](https://github.com/drevops/behat-screenshot) package).

In CI, screenshots are stored as build artifacts. In GitHub Actions, they can be
downloaded from the `Summary` tab. In CircleCI they are accessible in
the `Artifacts` tab.

### Format

Out of the box, **Vortex** comes with [Behat Progress formatter](https://github.com/drevops/behat-format-progress-fail)
output formatter to show progress as TAP and failures inline. This allows to
continue test runs after a failure while maintaining a minimal output.

### Reporting

Test reports are stored in `.logs/behat` directory.

CI usually uses them to to track test performance and stability.

### Boilerplate

**Vortex** provides BDD tests boilerplate for [homepage](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/behat/features/homepage.feature)
and [login](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/behat/features/login.feature)
user journeys.

These boilerplate tests run in CI when you install **Vortex** and can be used as
a starting point for writing your own.
