# Updating Vortex

**Vortex** differs from other project templates: after the initial setup, you can
update it to get the latest features and bug fixes.

After the update, review and commit the changes to your project.

If you’ve modified files provided by Vortex, the update will overwrite them
since **Vortex** doesn’t track your changes. You’ll need to manually accept or
reject the updates.
