# Updating Vortex

**Vortex** differs from other project templates: after the initial setup, you can
update it to get the latest features and bug fixes without losing your project customizations.

## Overview

Updating Vortex allows existing projects to benefit from:
- Security patches and bug fixes
- New features and workflow improvements
- Updated dependencies and tooling
- Enhanced deployment capabilities

After the update, review and commit the changes to your project to maintain version control and track what has changed.

We recommend updating Vortex monthly or at least quarterly to keep your project
secure and up-to-date.

## Before updating

Check the release notes for the latest version to understand what has changed
and if there are any breaking changes that may affect your project.

Specifically check if any environment variables were added or changed.

## Update process

1. Create a new branch for the update:
   ```shell title="Create a new branch for the update"
   git checkout -b update-vortex
   ```

2. Run the update command:
   ```shell title="Update to the latest version"
   ahoy update-vortex
   ```

   or update to a specific version or commit:

   ```shell title="Update to a specific version"
   ahoy update-vortex https://github.com/drevops/vortex.git@1.2.3

   ahoy update-vortex https://github.com/drevops/vortex.git@abcd123
   ```

3. Review the changes made by the update and selectively add them.

   It may be a good idea to commit changes in smaller chunks to make it easier
   to review and revert if necessary.

   Note that `composer.json` would be most likely deviated from the Vortex
   version, so you may want to additionally review the changes to the package
   versions and dependencies. We recommend temporarily reverting changes to
   `composer.json` and `composer.lock` to preserve your project's version, and
   manually updating the packages versions in your `composer.json`.

   ```shell title="Review changes"
   git status
   git diff
   ```

4. Test the updated environment to ensure everything works as expected:
   ```shell title="Test the updated environment"
   ahoy build
   ```
5. Push to the remote repository, create a pull request, and observe the
   Continuous Integration run passing.
   ```shell title="Push the update branch"
   git push origin update-vortex
   ```

6. Observe that once the Continuous Integration run passes, the site is
   successfully deployed to the preview or staging environment. <br/>
   Thoroughly test the updated site in the preview or staging environment to
   ensure everything works as expected.

7. Schedule release to production environment and make sure to leave enough
   time for spot-check testing and potential rollbacks.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Update Vortex monthly or when security patches are released
2. **Test Updates**: Always test updates in development before applying to production
3. **Staged Rollout**: Update development → staging → production environments
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what changed and why
5. **Monitor After Update**: Watch for issues in the days following an update
