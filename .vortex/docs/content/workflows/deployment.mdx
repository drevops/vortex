# Deployment

The deployment to a remote location is performed by the
[`scripts/vortex/deploy.sh`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/scripts/vortex/deploy.sh) _router_
script.

The script runs in continuous integration pipeline only after all tests pass.

The script deploys the  code to a remote location by calling the
relevant scripts based on the type of deployment defined in `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_TYPES`
variable as a comma-separated list of one or multiple supported deployment types:

- `webhook` - a webhook URL is called via CURL.
- `artifact` - a [code artifact is created](/docs/tools/git-artifact) and sent to a remote repository.
- `lagoon` - a Lagoon's webhook URL is called via CURL to trigger a deployment in
  Lagoon.
- `docker` - a container image is built and pushed to a remote registry.

## Using deployments

## Deployment targets

Deployment targets can be branches and pull requests. These targets are defined
in the CI configuration files and the hosting platform.

By default, deployments are triggered when commits are pushed into the following
branches:
- `production`
- `main`
- `master`
- `develop`
- `release/**`
- `hotfix/**`
- `project/**`

This will run the deployment script to forward the code to the remote hosting
platform and tell it to use the current branch's code for the deployment.

When a pull request is raised against one of the branches above, a deployment
will run for the pull request's branch. Depending on the hosting platform, this
may create a temporary environment for the pull request with the name of the
pull request.

Note that `feature/*` or `bugfix/*` (or any other branches) branches are not
included in the default list of deployment targets. This is to prevent
deployments from branches that are typically short-lived and have a pull
request raised, which will trigger a deployment. Adding these branches to the
list of deployment targets will lead to duplicated CI runs and deployments.

`project/*` branches are long-lived branches that are typically used for
larger features or projects that may span multiple pull requests. Such branches
would be manually synced with the `develop` branch and deployed to a remote
environment for testing. An example of this would be a migration branch that
has migration code and configuration that is not yet ready to be merged into
`develop` but needs to be deployed to a remote environment for testing.

### Deployment action

By default, an existing database will be retained during a deployment.

To change this behavior and overwrite the database with a fresh copy from
production environment, set the `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_ACTION` variable to
`deploy_override_db`.

## Skipping all deployments

You can skip all deployments by setting the `VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP` environment
variable to `1`.

This is especially useful in continuous integration pipelines where you may want to build and test
without triggering a deployment.

### Skipping deployments for a specific Pull Requests or branches

To skip a specific Pull Request or branch using the `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP`
variable, you would define additional environment variables with a specific
naming convention in your continuous integration pipeline configuration.

Here's an example of how this can be done:

#### Skipping a specific Pull Request

   Suppose you want to skip the deployment for Pull Request number 42. You would
   set the following environment variable:

   ```bash
   VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP_PR_42=1
   ```

#### Skipping a specific branch

   Suppose you want to skip the deployment for a branch named `feature-x`. You
   would first create a "safe" version of the branch name by replacing any
   special characters with underscores.

   Set the following environment variable:

   ```bash
   VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP_BRANCH_FEATURE_X=1
   ```
