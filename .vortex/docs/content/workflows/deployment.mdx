# Deployment

The deployment to a remote location is performed by the
[`scripts/vortex/deploy.sh`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/scripts/vortex/deploy.sh) _router_
script.

The script runs in continuous integration pipeline only after all tests pass.

The script deploys the  code to a remote location by calling the
relevant scripts based on the type of deployment defined in `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_TYPES`
variable as a comma-separated list of one or multiple supported deployment types:

- `webhook` - a webhook URL is called via CURL.
- `artifact` - a [code artifact is created](/docs/tools/git-artifact) and sent to a remote repository.
- `lagoon` - a Lagoon's webhook URL is called via CURL to trigger a deployment in
  Lagoon.
- `docker` - a container image is built and pushed to a remote registry.

## Using deployments

### Deployment action

By default, an existing database will be retained during a deployment.

To change this behavior and overwrite the database with a fresh copy from
production environment, set the `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_ACTION` variable to
`deploy_override_db`.

## Skipping all deployments

You can skip all deployments by setting the `VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP` environment
variable to `1`.

This is especially useful in continuous integration pipelines where you may want to build and test
without triggering a deployment.

### Skipping deployments for a specific Pull Requests or branches

To skip a specific Pull Request or branch using the `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP`
variable, you would define additional environment variables with a specific
naming convention in your continuous integration pipeline configuration.

Here's an example of how this can be done:

#### Skipping a specific Pull Request:

   Suppose you want to skip the deployment for Pull Request number 42. You would
   set the following environment variable:

   ```bash
   VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP_PR_42=1
   ```

#### Skipping a specific branch:

   Suppose you want to skip the deployment for a branch named `feature-x`. You
   would first create a "safe" version of the branch name by replacing any
   special characters with underscores.

   Set the following environment variable:

   ```bash
   VORTEX_DEPLOY_SKIP_BRANCH_FEATURE_X=1
   ```
