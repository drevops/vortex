**Vortex** is a Drupal project template designed to streamline onboarding,
accelerate development, and support long-term maintainability.

It provides a complete foundation for building and deploying Drupal sites —
including containerized local environments, automated testing and code quality
tools, CI/CD pipeline configurations, and integrations with popular hosting
platforms. Everything is pre-configured and ready to use, so teams can focus on
building features instead of setting up infrastructure.

By standardizing project structure and tooling, **Vortex** ensures a consistent
developer experience across every project that uses it. Whether you’re starting
fresh or joining an existing Vortex-based site, you can get up to speed quickly
and start contributing right away.

The template is actively maintained and kept in sync with the latest tools.
Every change is verified through automated tests to ensure updates remain stable
and reliable — reducing the risk of regressions and making it easier to maintain
projects over time.
