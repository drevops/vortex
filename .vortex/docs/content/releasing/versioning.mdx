# Version scheme

**Vortex** supports [CalVer](https://calver.org/) and [SemVer](https://semver.org/) version numbering schemes to fit different project needs.

During installation, you can choose between Calendar Versioning (CalVer), Semantic Versioning (SemVer), or a custom scheme.

## Calendar versioning (CalVer)

**Format:** `YY.M.Z` (e.g., `25.1.0`, `25.11.1`)

- `YY` = Short year (no leading zeroes)
- `M` = Short month (no leading zeroes)
- `Z` = Hotfix/patch version (no leading zeroes)

### Why CalVer

- **Release frequency transparency**: When you have multiple releases per month, dates make it easy to identify when a release happened
- **Intuitive tracking**: Stakeholders can immediately understand "this is from January 2025" vs memorizing version numbers
- **Natural progression**: No ambiguity about major vs minor changes - just the chronological order
- **Marketing alignment**: Easier to communicate to non-technical audiences ("our Q1 2025 release")

### Examples

- ✅ Correct: `25.1.0`, `25.11.1`, `25.1.10`, `25.10.1`, `9.12.0`
- ❌ Incorrect: `25.0.0` (no month 0), `2025.1.1` (full year), `25.01.0` (leading zero), `01.1.0` (leading zero in year)

## Semantic versioning (SemVer)

**Format:** `X.Y.Z` (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.3.5`)

- `X` = Major release version (no leading zeroes)
- `Y` = Minor release version (no leading zeroes)
- `Z` = Hotfix/patch version (no leading zeroes)

### Why SemVer

- **Breaking change communication**: Major version bump signals incompatible API changes
- **Dependency management**: Package managers can enforce compatible version ranges
- **Developer expectations**: Well-understood convention in the development community
- **Predictable upgrades**: Minor versions add functionality, patches fix bugs

### Examples

- ✅ Correct: `0.1.0`, `1.0.0`, `1.0.1`, `1.0.10`
- ❌ Incorrect: `0.1` (missing patch), `1` (missing minor and patch), `1.0.01` (leading zero)

## Other

Choose "Other" if you have a custom versioning scheme or don't want to commit to CalVer or SemVer. This option removes both versioning templates from your documentation, allowing you to define your own approach.

## Configuration

Your project's version scheme is configured once during installation and stored in `.env`:

```shell
VORTEX_RELEASE_VERSION_SCHEME=calver  # or semver, or other
```

### Release notes publishing

For CalVer and SemVer projects, **Vortex** provides a GitHub Actions workflow to automate release notes drafting:

- **Draft release notes** are automatically updated when commits are pushed to the `develop` branch
- Next version is calculated based on your version scheme
- Release notes accumulate changes until the release is finalized
- On release finish, you can use the draft to publish the final release notes
