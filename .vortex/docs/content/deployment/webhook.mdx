# Webhook deployment

Webhook deployment triggers a remote deployment by calling an HTTP endpoint.

This is useful for integrating with external systems or custom deployment
pipelines that expose webhook URLs.

## How it works

When `webhook` is included in `$VORTEX_DEPLOY_TYPES`, the deployment script
calls the configured webhook URL using CURL, passing deployment information
as parameters.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `VORTEX_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL` | **Yes** | | Hosting/CI | The webhook URL to call |
| `VORTEX_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_METHOD` | No | `GET` | `.env` | HTTP method (GET, POST) |
| `VORTEX_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_STATUS` | No | `200` | `.env` | Expected HTTP response status code |

### Setup

1. Add `webhook` to the `VORTEX_DEPLOY_TYPES` variable in your `.env` file:

   ```shell title=".env"
   VORTEX_DEPLOY_TYPES=webhook
   ```

2. Add `VORTEX_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL` to your CI provider's environment variables
   (this should be kept secret).

## Use cases

- Triggering deployments on platforms that provide webhook endpoints
- Integrating with custom deployment orchestration systems
- Notifying external services when code is ready for deployment
