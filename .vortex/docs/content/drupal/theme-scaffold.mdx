# Theme scaffold

[Theme scaffold](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/tree/develop/web/themes/custom/your_site_theme)
is an example of a Drupal theme.

We recommend creating a custom `your_site_theme` theme for your project to place
custom styling and front-end functionality specific to your site.

The theme uses the site machine name convention (`your_site_theme` in this case),
while modules use the abbreviated prefix (`ys_` for `your_site`).

:::info

We understand that front-end theming is often highly project-specific and
subject to team preferences. The provided `your_site_theme` scaffold is not
intended to dictate how your theme should be built — it simply demonstrates how
custom themes can _integrate_ with the **Vortex** tooling and workflows.

Feel free to adapt or replace it with your preferred theme.

:::

## Build system

The theme includes a complete Node.js-based build system using [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/):

- **SCSS compilation**
- **JavaScript concatenation and minification**
- **CSS auto-prefixing** for browser compatibility
- **Linting** for both CSS ([Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)) and JavaScript ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/))
- **Watch mode** for development workflow

### Build commands

```bash
cd web/themes/custom/your_site_theme

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build production assets
yarn run build

# Build development assets (unminified)
yarn run build-dev

# Run linting
yarn run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
yarn run lint-fix

# Watch for changes during development
yarn run watch
```

Ahoy commands are configured to call the appropriate Yarn scripts from the
theme directory:

```bash
# Install front-end dependencies
ahoy fei

# Build production assets
ahoy fe

# Build development assets (unminified)
ahoy fed

# Watch for changes during development
ahoy few

# Lint front-end code
ahoy lint-fe
```

These commands run within the container to use the Node.js environment
and tools installed there, ensuring consistency across development environments.

:::tip

When adding your own theme with a custom build system, it's a good idea to
follow the same command structure and naming conventions. This keeps things
consistent across projects and makes it easier for other developers to work with
the build system without learning a new workflow.

```

## Libraries

The theme defines asset libraries in `your_site_theme.libraries.yml` for
organized CSS and JavaScript loading with proper dependencies and browser
compatibility.

## Tests scaffold

The `tests` directory contains working examples of tests that can be used as a
starting point in your project.

It also has a set of helper `Traits` that you may find useful when writing your
tests. Simply remove them if you do not need them.

the theme.
