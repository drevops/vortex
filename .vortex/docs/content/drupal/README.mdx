# Drupal

When it comes to Drupal code, **Vortex** offers several key components:
1. [Composer configuration](composer)
2. [Settings management](settings)
3. [Provision script](provision)
4. [Module scaffold with tests scaffold](module-scaffold)
5. [Theme scaffold](theme-scaffold)

## Included modules

Please note that **Vortex** is not a Drupal distribution, and it does not aim
to provide a full Drupal installation profile or a set of recipes. Instead, it
provides you with a minimal set of modules and dependencies to get you started.

You would add more modules and themes once you finish the initial setup.
