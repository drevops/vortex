# Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP projects, including Drupal. It allows
you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages them for you.

**Vortex** comes with a pre-configured `composer.json` file based on
the [Drupal Composer project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project),
extended to support additional features and tools.

:::note

    See [Working with packages](../workflows/development#packages) for more information
    on how to add and manage dependencies in your project.

## Drupal Composer project

[Drupal Composer project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)
provides a starter kit for managing your site dependencies with Composer.

**Vortex** extends the Drupal Composer project's `composer.json` to support
additional features and tools.

**Vortex** team will keep the `composer.json` file up-to-date with the
latest version of the `composer.json` in the [Drupal Composer project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project),
so you can always make sure you are using the best community practices.

## `composer.json`

The `composer.json` file is the core configuration file for Composer, detailing
your project's dependencies, scripts, and settings.

This section provides an overview of each part of the `composer.json` file,
explaining its role and how it contributes to your project's setup and
management.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!./../../../../composer.json';

</details>

### `name`

[`name`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#package-names) is a
unique identifier for the project in Composer's ecosystem consisting of a vendor
name and the project's name.

### `description`

A brief summary of the project's purpose.

### `type`

`type` is used to specify the type of the package. This is important because it
tells Composer and any systems integrating with Composer how to treat the
package. The type key can influence how the package is installed and used.

### `license`

[license](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#license) indicates the
licence of the project. Since **Vortex** is a template for your consumer sites
that are usually proprietary, we use `proprietary` as the default value. More
license identifiers are listed at
the [SPDX Open Source License Registry](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

### `repositories`

The [`repositories`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#repositories)
section defines custom package repositories, essential for accessing packages
outside the default Packagist repository.

See [Working with packages](../workflows/development#packages) for more information on
how to provide custom and override existing packages in your project.

- [`drupal`](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-packagesdrupalorg):
  Serves as the official source for Drupal modules, themes, and distributions.
  It's crucial for a Drupal project using Composer, as it allows access to
  Drupal-specific packages not available on Packagist.
- [`asset-packagist`](https://asset-packagist.org/): Enables the installation of
  Bower and NPM packages via Composer. This is especially important for Drupal
  projects needing front-end libraries and tools, bridging the gap between
  Composer's PHP-centric ecosystem and the broader world of front-end package
  management.

### `require`

The [`require`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require) section
specifies the essential packages and libraries your project needs.

- `php`: Specifies the minimum PHP version required to run this project. This
  should be specified as a range rather than an exact version number.
  E.g. `>=8.2` and not `8.2.0`.
- [`composer/installers`](https://github.com/composer/installers): Allows to
  install packages to the correct location based on the specified package type
  such as `drupal-module`, `drupal-theme`, `drupal-profile`, etc.
- [`cweagans/composer-patches`](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches):
  Allows applying patches to Composer packages, useful for incorporating fixes
  not yet in official releases.

  information on how to work with patches.
- `drupal/admin_toolbar`, `drupal/clamav`, `drupal/coffee`, etc. - Drupal
  modules that provide various site administration and development helping
  functionalities that is usually installed across all of your Drupal sites.
  **Vortex** comes with [pre-configured settings](settings.mdx) for some of the
  modules to make them work out of the box.
- [`drupal/core-recommended`](https://github.com/drupal/core-recommended): A

  scripting interface for Drupal, providing a wide range of utilities to manage
  and interact with your Drupal sites.
- [`oomphinc/composer-installers-extender`](https://github.com/oomphinc/composer-installers-extender):
  Allows any package to be installed to a directory other than the
  default `vendor` directory within a project on a package-by-package basis.
  This plugin extends the `composer/installers` plugin to allow any arbitrary
  package type to be handled by their custom installer.
- [`webflo/drupal-finder`](https://github.com/webflo/drupal-finder): Locates
  Drupal installations in a directory structure.

### `require-dev`

The [`require-dev`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require-dev)
section lists packages used for development purposes, like code quality checks
and testing. These tools are essential for development but not required in
production environments. This distinction helps to keep the production
deployment streamlined and efficient, while still supporting a comprehensive and
effective development environment.

- [`behat/behat`](https://github.com/Behat/Behat): A PHP framework for
  Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), allowing you to write human-readable

- [`vincentLanglet/Twig-CS-Fixer`](https://github.com/VincentLanglet/Twig-CS-Fixer): This tool
  ensures that Twig templates adhere to a set coding standard, helping maintain
  consistency and readability in template files.

### `conflict`

The [`conflict`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#conflict) section
prevents installation conflicts with standalone Drupal core, crucial for
avoiding version clashes and ensuring consistency in core files.

### `minimum-stability`

The [`minimum-stability`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability)
setting controls the minimum stability level of the packages that Composer is
allowed to install. By setting it to `"stable"`, you are instructing Composer to
prefer stable versions of packages over their unstable (like `beta` or `alpha`)
versions.

### `prefer-stable`

The [`prefer-stable`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#prefer-stable)
settings, when set to `true`, instructs Composer to prefer stable versions of
packages even when the `minimum-stability` setting allows less stable versions.
This is especially useful in a mixed stability scenario where some dependencies
might not have a stable release yet. It ensures that Composer will use stable
versions wherever possible, thus providing a balance between stability and the
need for newer features or fixes that might only be available in a less stable
package version.

### `config`

The [`config`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#config) section
specifies key configurations for Composer's behavior in the project.

- [`allow-plugins`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#allow-plugins):
  This setting specifies which Composer plugins are allowed to run. It's a
  security measure to prevent the execution of untrusted code from third-party
  plugins. Each plugin needs to be explicitly allowed to ensure it can execute.
- [`discard-changes`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#discard-changes):
  When set to `true`, any local changes made to the dependencies (packages under
  version control like Git) are discarded without prompting when you run
  composer install or composer update. Composer will overwrite the local changes
  with the data from the source repository.
- [`platform`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#platform): Specifies the
  PHP version of the platform environment where the current project runs. This
  should be specified as an exact version number (e.g. `8.2.0`). Should be kept
  in sync with the `php` version in the [Docker containers](../tools/docker.mdx).
- [`sort-packages`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#sort-packages):
  When set to `true`, this configuration ensures that packages are sorted
  in `composer.json` and `composer.lock`. It makes these files more readable and
  helps reduce merge conflicts in version control.

### `autoload`

The [`autoload`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) section is
essential for defining how Composer automatically loads PHP classes within the
project, without needing to manually include or require each class file.

### `autoload-dev`

The [`autoload-dev`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload-dev)
section is essential for defining how Composer automatically loads PHP
development-specific classes within the project, without needing to manually
include or require each class file.

### `extra`

The [`extra`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#extra) section serves as
a source of custom configuration for various packages. These packages read
settings from this section to tailor their behavior according to the specific
needs and structure of your Drupal project.

- [`composer-exit-on-patch-failure`](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches):
  This setting, when enabled, causes Composer to exit if a patch from
  the `cweagans/composer-patches` plugin fails to apply.
- [`drupal-scaffold`](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-drupals-composer-scaffold):
  This setting controls which files should be scaffolded:
  - `locations`: Specifies the location of the web root (the directory
    containing the `index.php` file).
  - `file-mapping`: Determines which files are managed by the scaffold process.
    **Vortex** comes with sensible defaults, but you can customize this section to
    suit your needs.
- [`installer-paths`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-do-i-install-a-package-to-a-custom-path-for-my-framework.md):
  Defines custom installation paths for various types of packages like Drupal
  modules, themes, and libraries.
- `installer-types`: Specifies additional installer types, such as `bower-asset`
  and `npm-asset`, that are handled by
  the `oomphinc/composer-installers-extender` plugin.
- `patchLevel`: Defines the patch level for specific packages, in this
  case, `drupal/core`. The `-p` option followed by a number (e.g., `-p1`, `-p2`)
  in patch commands specifies the number of leading directories to strip from
  the file paths found in the patch file. This determines how the paths in the
  patch file are interpreted relative to the current directory where the patch
  is being applied.
- `patches`: Specifies the patches to be applied to specific packages.
  See [Working with packages](../workflows/development#patching) for more
  information on how to work with patches.

### `scripts`

The [`scripts`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#scripts) section
defines custom scripts to be executed at specific points in Composer's workflow,
enhancing the automation and maintenance of your Drupal project.

- [`pre-install-cmd`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#pre-install-cmd):
  Executes scripts before the `composer install` command is run. In your
  configuration, `DrupalProject\composer\ScriptHandler::checkComposerVersion` is
  specified, which ensures that the Composer version being used is compatible
  with your project setup. This is vital for maintaining consistency and
  avoiding issues due to version mismatches.
- [`pre-update-cmd`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#pre-update-cmd):
  Runs scripts before the `composer update` command is executed. It uses the
  same script as `pre-install-cmd` to check the Composer version, ensuring that
  updates to your project’s dependencies are compatible with your current
  Composer setup.
- [`post-install-cmd`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#post-install-cmd):
  Invoked after the `composer install` command completes. The
  script `DrupalProject\composer\ScriptHandler::createRequiredFiles` is
  executed, which typically handles tasks like setting up default files and
  configurations necessary for the Drupal installation.
- [`post-update-cmd`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#post-update-cmd):
  Executes scripts after the `composer update` command. It calls the
  same `createRequiredFiles` method as in `post-install-cmd`, ensuring that
  necessary files and configurations are updated or re-established following an
  update of dependencies.
