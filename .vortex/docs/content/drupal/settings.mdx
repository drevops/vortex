# Settings

Drupal site configuration — including database connections, file paths, and
environment-specific behavior — is controlled through the `settings.php` and
`services.yml` files. This section explains how **Vortex** structures and
extends these files to support consistent setup across environments.

**Vortex** ships with its own streamlined version of
the [`settings.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/settings.php) and
[`services.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/services.yml) files.

It provides logic to detect the current environment (such as local, CI, or
production) and apply settings conditionally. You can also define configuration
overrides for individual modules if needed.

The default **Drupal Scaffold**'s [`default.settings.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/default.settings.php)
and [`default.services.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/default.services.yml)
files are also provided if you choose to use them instead.

## Approach

Managing Drupal settings across multiple environments — such as local, CI,
development, staging, and production — often requires conditional configuration.
Different environments may need to enable or disable modules, change performance
settings, use different APIs, or point to different services.

The challenge is that Drupal doesn’t offer a standard way to manage these
environment-specific differences. Its configuration system is not designed to
handle conditional logic, such as applying different settings based on runtime
environment, or retrieving values from environment variables.

Modules like `config_split` can help by allowing you to maintain separate
configuration sets per environment, but they are limited: they don’t support
environment-based conditions inside the configuration YAML files, cannot access
environment variables directly, and are not suitable when you need dynamic logic
(e.g. setting values based on external service URLs).

**Vortex** does support `config_split` as part of its standard tooling, and it’s
ideal for use cases where declarative configuration is sufficient — for example,
enabling a module in staging but not production. However, when settings require
conditional logic or need to pull values from the environment, `config_split`
does not suffice. In addition, it is not possible to automatically test which
settings are applied in a specific environment.

**Vortex** addresses this problem with a clear and maintainable approach:
- The _environment type_ is [detected](#environment-type-detection) based on the
  environment where the site is running. This detection step is isolated and
  does not apply any configuration overrides.
- Configuration overrides are defined in [per-module override files](#per-module-overrides),
  with conditions applied based on the detected _environment type_.

This structure offers several benefits:
- It keeps environment detection separate from configuration logic.
- It makes it easy to see how a module behaves in a specific environment — all
in one place.
- If a module is no longer needed, its override file can be safely removed
without modifying the `settings.php` file.
- It prevents environment-specific settings from leaking into unrelated parts of
the configuration.

## Guidelines

When working with settings, follow these guidelines to ensure clarity, consistency, and maintainability:
-	**Do not modify `settings.php` directly.<br/>**
  Use environment variables for [general](#general) settings or [per-module override files](#per-module-overrides)
  for any custom or environment-aware configuration.

-	**Keep all overrides isolated by module.**<br/>
  Each file should encapsulate logic for a single module only. If a module is
  removed, its override file should be removable without affecting unrelated
  settings.

-	**Use environment variables for configuration that changes by environment.**<br/>
  Prefix all such variables with `DRUPAL_` (e.g. `DRUPAL_MY_SETTING`) to easily
  distinguish them from other environment variables.<br/>
  Always define a default hardcoded value for each environment variable.

-	**Use conditions based on _environment type_ within per-module override files.**<br/>
  This allows for environment-specific configuration without cluttering the main
  `settings.php` file.<br/>
  Use the `$settings['environment']` variable to check the current _environment type_.

## Settings file structure

The [`settings.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/settings.php)
file is organized into the following sections:

- [Database](#database)
- [General](#general)
- [Environment type detection](#environment-type-detection)
- [Per-module overrides](#per-module-overrides)
- [Local overrides](#local-overrides)

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

### Database

Database configuration is managed through environment variables with sensible
defaults, offering flexibility across hosting environments while keeping the
setup consistent.

To support a variety of hosting providers and container platforms, multiple
environment variable names are accepted for each setting:

| Variable             | Alternative Variables                   | Default              | Purpose           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `DATABASE_NAME`      | `DATABASE_DATABASE`, `MARIADB_DATABASE` | `drupal`             | Database name     |
| `DATABASE_USERNAME`  | `MARIADB_USERNAME`                      | `drupal`             | Database username |
| `DATABASE_PASSWORD`  | `MARIADB_PASSWORD`                      | `drupal`             | Database password |
| `DATABASE_HOST`      | `MARIADB_HOST`                          | `localhost`          | Database host     |
| `DATABASE_PORT`      | `MARIADB_PORT`                          | `3306`               | Database port     |
| `DATABASE_CHARSET`   | `MARIADB_CHARSET`, `MYSQL_CHARSET`      | `utf8mb4`            | Character set     |
| `DATABASE_COLLATION` | `MARIADB_COLLATION`, `MYSQL_COLLATION`  | `utf8mb4_general_ci` | Collation         |

These variables normally should not be modified unless you are using a
custom database setup or a different hosting provider that requires specific
configuration. The defaults are designed to work with most common setups,
including local development environments and popular hosting providers.

### General

This section configures generic site settings such as file paths, security
patterns, performance optimizations, and essential directories. These settings
are identical across all _environment types_.

The following environment variables can be used to customize general settings:

| Variable                    | Alternative Variables | Default                        | Purpose                                  |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `DRUPAL_CONFIG_PATH`        |                       | `../config/default`            | Location of configuration sync directory |
| `DRUPAL_PUBLIC_FILES`       |                       | `sites/default/files`          | Public files directory path              |
| `DRUPAL_PRIVATE_FILES`      |                       | `sites/default/files/private`  | Private files directory path             |
| `DRUPAL_TEMPORARY_FILES`    |                       | `/tmp`                         | Temporary files directory path           |
| `DRUPAL_HASH_SALT`          |                       | _Generated from database host_ | Cryptographic salt for security          |
| `DRUPAL_TIMEZONE`           | `TZ`                  | `UTC`          | Site timezone                            |
| `DRUPAL_MAINTENANCE_THEME`  | `DRUPAL_THEME`        | `claro`                        | Theme used during maintenance mode       |
| `DRUPAL_CACHE_PAGE_MAX_AGE` |                       | `900`                          | Page cache expiration time (seconds)     |

### Environment type detection

**Vortex** defines an _environment type_ to represent the context in which the
Drupal site is running — such as local, CI, development, staging, or production.
This concept allows the system to conditionally adjust settings and behaviors
depending on the runtime environment.

The _environment type_ is detected automatically based on known hosting provider
indicators or predefined environment variables. Detection logic is intentionally
isolated from configuration logic — it identifies the context but does not apply
any overrides directly.

Once detected, the environment type is stored in the `$settings['environment']`
value, which can be used by modules, settings overrides, and shell scripts to
drive environment-specific behavior.

#### Environment type constants

**Vortex** defines the following constants to represent supported environments:
- `ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL`
- `ENVIRONMENT_CI`
- `ENVIRONMENT_DEV`
- `ENVIRONMENT_STAGE`
- `ENVIRONMENT_PROD`

These constants are used consistently across settings files and scripts to
determine conditional behavior.

#### Detection mechanism

The detection process uses indicators provided by known cloud hosting platforms. Logic
for supported providers is stored in the `includes/providers` directory.

To add support for a custom platform, simply create a `settings.[provider].php`
file in that directory with the relevant detection logic.

-	If a provider is detected, the default environment type is set to `ENVIRONMENT_DEV`.
-	Additional provider-specific conditions can elevate this to `ENVIRONMENT_STAGE` or `ENVIRONMENT_PROD`.
-	If no provider is detected, the environment type defaults to `ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL`.

It is important to note that this detection logic is only responsible for
identifying the environment type. It does not apply any configuration changes.
Those are handled separately in per-module override files, making the setup
modular and independent of the cloud hosting platforms.

#### Overriding environment type

You can override the detected environment type by setting the
`DRUPAL_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.

This is useful when:
-	Testing environment-specific behavior locally.
-	Working around gaps in the detection logic.
-	Forcing a known environment type for debugging.

For example, add `DRUPAL_ENVIRONMENT=ci` to your `.env.local` file to simulate
the CI environment locally.

### Per-module overrides

This section automatically includes module-specific settings from files in the
`includes/modules` directory. Each file follows the naming pattern
`settings.[module].php` and contains configuration overrides for a specific
Drupal module.

**Vortex** ships with pre-configured settings for several popular contributed
modules, each isolated in its own file for easy maintenance and removal.

#### Creating custom module settings

To add settings for a new module, create a file following the naming pattern:

```
web/sites/default/includes/modules/settings.[module_name].php
```

Each settings file should:
- Use environment type constants (`ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL`, `ENVIRONMENT_PROD`, etc.) for conditional logic
- Leverage environment variables for configuration values
- Provide sensible defaults when environment variables are not set
- Be self-contained and removable without affecting other modules

### Local overrides

At the end of the `settings.php`, there is an option to include additional local
settings. This allows you to override some settings for the local
environment without affecting the main configuration. You can
copy `default.settings.local.php` and `default.services.local.yml`
to `settings.local.php` and `services.local.yml`, respectively, to utilize this
functionality.

## Testing settings with unit tests

**Vortex** includes a [set of unit tests](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/phpunit/Drupal)
to verify that settings are applied correctly for each detected environment
type.

These tests are intended to be maintained within your project, helping you
ensure that environment-driven configuration — including both environment types
and environment variables — behaves as expected.

To run unit tests for settings:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --group=drupal_settings
```

You may simply remove these tests if you do not want to maintain them.
