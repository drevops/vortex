# Settings

The `settings.php` file provides the primary configuration for a Drupal site,
including its database connection, file paths, and various other settings.

**Vortex** ships with own streamlined version of
the [`settings.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/settings.php) and
[`services.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/services.yml) files.

It also provides [Settings unit tests](#testing-settings-with-unit-tests) to ensure that
the settings apply correctly when a site runs in a specific environment. These
tests are intended to be maintained within your project, ensuring that the
settings activated within a specific _environment type_ and with specific
_environment variables_ applied correctly.

The default **Drupal Scaffold**'s [`default.settings.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/default.settings.php)
and [`default.services.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/default.services.yml)
files are also provided if you choose to use them instead.

The [`settings.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/sites/default/settings.php) file is divided
into several sections:

1. [Environment type constants definitions](#1-environment-type-constants-definitions)
2. [Site-specific settings](#2-site-specific-settings)
3. [Environment detection](#3-environment-type-detection)
4. [Per-environment overrides](#4-per-environment-overrides)
5. [Inclusion of generated Settings](#5-inclusion-of-per-module-settings)
6. [Inclusion of local settings](#6-inclusion-of-local-settings)

### 1. Environment type constants definitions

Constants for various _environment types_  are defined here. These can be used to
alter site behavior based on the active _environment type_.

Available _environment type_ constants are:

- `ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL`
- `ENVIRONMENT_CI`
- `ENVIRONMENT_PROD`
- `ENVIRONMENT_STAGE`
- `ENVIRONMENT_DEV`

These are later used to set `$settings['environment']`, which can be
used in the modules and shell scripts to target code execution to specific
_environments types_.

:::info[EXAMPLE]

    ```shell
    if drush php:eval "print \Drupal\core\Site\Settings::get('environment');" | grep -q -e ci -e local; then
      # Do something only in ci or local environments.
    fi
    ```

:::

### 2. Site-specific settings

This section is used for configuring core site settings such as defining paths,
ensuring security with trusted host patterns, setting performance optimizations
like aggregating CSS and JS files, and specifying essential directories for
Drupal's functionality.

These settings are identical for all _environment types_ .

Use per-module settings files in the [`web/site/default/includes/modules`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/tree/develop/web/sites/default/includes/modules)
directory to override per-module settings.

### 3. Environment type detection

This section uses known hosting providers mechanisms to determine the
_environment type_ where the site currently runs.

Settings for the supported hosting providers are stored in the
[`web/site/default/includes/providers`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/tree/develop/web/sites/default/includes/providers)
directory. You can add your own custom provider _environment type_ detection logic
by creating a new file `settings.[provider].php` in this directory.

Once a hosting provider is detected, the _environment type_
`$settings['environment']` is set to
`ENVIRONMENT_DEV` for all environments as a default.

Higher-level environments types (`PROD`, `STAGE` etc.) are then set based on
the **additional** detected provider-specific settings.

When the hosting provider is not detected, the default value is set to
`ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL`.

:::note

    Environment type detection settings are only used for _environment type_
    detection and not for environment-specific settings. Those are defined in
    the [Per-environment overrides](#4-per-environment-overrides) section.
    This approach allows for a more flexible and maintainable configuration
    independent of a specific hosting provider.

:::

#### Overriding environment type

It is also possible to force specific _environment type_ by setting
`DRUPAL_ENVIRONMENT` _environment variable_.

This is useful in cases where a certain behavior is required for a specific
environment, but the _environment type_ detection logic does not provide it.

It is also useful when debugging _environment type_-specific issues locally.
For example, you can set `DRUPAL_ENVIRONMENT=ci` in your `.env.local` file and
run the site locally with the CI environment settings.

### 4. Per-environment overrides

Configurations in this section alter the site's behavior based on the detected
_environment type_ (see [Environment type detection](#3-environment-type-detection)
above). Out-of-the-box, **Vortex** provides overrides for CI and Local
environments.

You can add additional overrides for other _environment types_  as needed.

### 5. Inclusion of per-module settings

This section includes any additional module-specific settings from the
[`web/site/default/includes/modules`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/tree/develop/web/sites/default/includes/modules) directory.

**Vortex** ships with settings overrides for several popular contributed
modules.

The per _environment type_ overrides for each module should be placed into the
module-specific settings file.

### 6. Inclusion of local settings

At the end of the `settings.php`, there is an option to include additional local
settings. This allows developers to override some settings for their local
environment without affecting the main configuration. Developers can
copy `default.settings.local.php` and `default.services.local.yml`
to `settings.local.php` and `services.local.yml`, respectively, to utilize this
functionality.

## Testing settings with unit tests

**Vortex** provides a [set of unit tests](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/tests/phpunit/Drupal) that
ensure that the settings apply correctly per environment type. These tests are
expected to be maintained within your project, ensuring that settings activated
by a specific _environment type_ and _environment variables_ are applied correctly.

After installing **Vortex**, run `vendor/bin/phpunit --group=drupal_settings` to
run the tests for the settings provided by **Vortex**.

You may simply remove these tests if you do not want to maintain them.
