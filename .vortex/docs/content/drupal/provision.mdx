# Provision

The provisioning process, handled by the
[`provision.sh`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/scripts/vortex/provision.sh)
script, sets up a
Drupal site on already assembled codebase by either importing an existing
database from the dump or installing a fresh instance of Drupal using a profile,
followed by running the necessary configuration import and database updates.

The main purpose of the script is to automate the setup of a Drupal site
in every environment, ensuring consistency and eliminating manual steps.

## Rationale

While `drush deploy` is a powerful tool for executing standard Drupal deployment
steps (such as configuration import and database updates), it assumes that the
site is already in a bootstrapped, stable state. In practice, especially during
initial setup or provisioning in dynamic environments (like CI pipelines,
container rebuilds, or multisite setups), additional orchestration is needed.

The `provision.sh` script addresses these gaps by:
- **Bootstrapping the environment:** It can import a database dump or install a fresh Drupal instance from a
profile.
- **Handling conditional logic:** It accounts for different runtime scenarios, such as skipping provisioning,
enforcing fresh database imports, or using maintenance mode.
- **Enforcing consistency:** The same provisioning logic runs across local, CI, staging, and production
environments, eliminating “it works on my machine” issues.
- **Supporting extensibility:** It allows for custom post-provisioning scripts, making it easy to layer in
project-specific logic like enabling test modules or running migrations.

In short, `provision.sh` wraps `drush deploy` in a consistent, repeatable, and
configurable process — turning a manual setup step into a reliable automation
layer.

## Database Import vs Full Provisioning

Vortex provides two main approaches for setting up your database:

### Full Provisioning (`ahoy provision`)

Runs the complete provisioning process including:
- Database import (from dump or profile installation)
- Configuration import (`drush config:import`)
- Database updates (`drush updatedb`)
- Post-provisioning custom scripts
- Cache rebuilds

Use this when you want a fully configured site ready for development or deployment.

### Database Import Only (`ahoy import-db`)
Imports only the database dump without running deployment scripts:
- Imports the database dump
- Skips configuration imports
- Skips database updates
- Skips post-provisioning scripts

```bash
# Import database only
ahoy import-db path/to/dump.sql

# Full provisioning (recommended for most cases)
ahoy provision
```

Use `ahoy import-db` when you only need the raw database data without any configuration changes or updates.

### Customizing flow

You can control the provisioning flow using the following environment variables:

1. `VORTEX_PROVISION_SKIP=1`<br/>Kill-switch to completely skip provisioning. The script will exit immediately after start. Useful in emergencies when any kind of automation needs to be disabled.<br/><br/>
2. `VORTEX_PROVISION_OVERRIDE_DB=1`<br/>Drop an existing database before importing from dump/installing from profile. This is useful when an already provisioned environment requires a fresh database to be imported.<br/><br/>
3. `VORTEX_PROVISION_TYPE=profile`<br/>Install from a Drupal `profile` instead of importing from a `database` dump. Useful for building sites without the persistent DB and/or test profile configuration installation.<br/><br/>
4. `VORTEX_PROVISION_POST_OPERATIONS_SKIP=1`<br/>Skip configuration imports, database updates, and other post-provisioning steps. Essentially, this is `drush sql:drop` and `$(drush sql:connect) < .data/db.sql` commands. This is useful when you want to provision a site without running any additional operations.<br/><br/>
5. `VORTEX_PROVISION_USE_MAINTENANCE_MODE=1`<br/>Enable maintenance mode right after the site is bootstrappable and disable it at the end. Useful when you want to prevent users from accessing the site while it is being provisioned.<br/><br/>
6. `VORTEX_PROVISION_SANITIZE_DB_SKIP=1`<br/>Disable database sanitization.

### Maintenance mode

During the provisioning process, you may want to enable maintenance mode to
prevent users from accessing the site while it is being updated.

To enable maintenance mode, set the `VORTEX_PROVISION_USE_MAINTENANCE_MODE=1`
environment variable in your `.env` file to apply it globally or set it in your
hosting provider's specific environment.

### Database sanitization

The `provision.sh` script includes a step to sanitize the database after
provisioning. This helps ensure that sensitive data — like real email addresses,
passwords, and user information — is replaced with safe, generic values in
non-production environments. It prevents issues like accidentally sending emails
to real users or exposing private data during testing, making shared
environments safer to work with.

:::warning

    Sanitization takes place only after the database is **imported**, so anyone
    with access to the dump file can still see sensitive data.

    If your database has highly sensitive data, consider sanitizing the database
    dump before it can be downloaded (sanitize on export). There are tools
    available for this purpose, such as [Drush GDPR Dumper](https://github.com/robiningelbrecht/drush-gdpr-dumper)
    or [MTK](https://github.com/skpr/mtk).

:::

The database sanitization step is enabled by default on all environments except
production. To disable database sanitization, set the
`VORTEX_PROVISION_SANITIZE_DB_SKIP=1` in the `.env` file or in your hosting
provider's specific environment.

#### Customizing database sanitization

Place these variables in the `.env` file or in your hosting provider's specific
environment to further customize the database sanitization:

1. `VORTEX_PROVISION_SANITIZE_DB_EMAIL=user_%uid@your-site-domain.example`<br/>Replace all emails with a tokenized email string.<br/><br/>
2. `VORTEX_PROVISION_SANITIZE_DB_PASSWORD=<random or exact>`<br/>Replace passwords with a random or exact value.<br/><br/>
3. `VORTEX_PROVISION_SANITIZE_DB_REPLACE_USERNAME_WITH_EMAIL=0`<br/>Replace username with email. Useful to also sanitize user names.<br/><br/>
4. `VORTEX_PROVISION_SANITIZE_DB_ADDITIONAL_FILE=./scripts/sanitize.sql`<br/>Path to a file with custom sanitization SQL queries.

## Running custom scripts

The `provision.sh` script can execute custom scripts after all provisioning
steps. This feature allows you to automate additional tasks specific to your
project, such as conditionally enabling modules or running migrations in a
specific order.

To run custom scripts, create a new file in the `scripts/custom` directory
with the `provision-` prefix and the `.sh` extension, and make it executable
with `chmod +x scripts/custom/provision-10-example.sh`. The script will be
automatically discovered and executed.

It is recommended to use a 2-digit suffix to control the order of execution:
e.g., `provision-10-example.sh`, `provision-20-another-example.sh`.

### Conditional execution

You may choose to only perform an action based on a specific environment (the
value of `$settings['environment']` is populated by
the [Drupal settings file](settings#environment-type-detection)):

```bash
environment="$(drush php:eval "print \Drupal\core\Site\Settings::get('environment');")"

if echo "${environment}" | grep -q -e dev -e stage -e ci -e local; then
  echo "> Running custom script for dev, stage, ci, or local environment."
  # Place your commands here.
else
  echo "> Skipping custom script for ${environment} environment."
fi
```

You may also conditionally perform an action based on whether the database is
freshly imported or not:

```bash
if [ "${VORTEX_PROVISION_OVERRIDE_DB:-0}" = "1" ]; then
  echo "> Fresh database detected."
else
  echo "> Existing database detected."
fi
```
