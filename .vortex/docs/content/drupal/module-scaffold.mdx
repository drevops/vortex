# Module scaffold

[Module scaffold](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/tree/develop/web/modules/custom/ys_base)
is an example of a Drupal module.

We recommend creating a custom `ys_base` module for your project to place
custom functionality that is not specific to a feature that can be placed in
a dedicated self-contained module.

The `ys` prefix is abbreviated from your project name (`your_site` in this case).
We recommend using this technique to prefix all modules, and use the site full
name for a theme name (`yoursite` in this case).

## Deploy file

The `ys_base.deploy` file is an example of a Drush deploy file that can be used
to run deployment commands during the site [provisioning](provision) process.

## Tests scaffold

The `tests` directory contains working examples of tests that can be used as a
starting point in your project.

It also has a set of helper `Traits` that you may find useful when writing your
tests. Or simply remove them if you do not find them useful.
