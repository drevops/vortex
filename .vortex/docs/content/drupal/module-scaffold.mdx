# Module scaffold

[Module scaffold](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/tree/develop/web/modules/custom/ys_base)
is an example of a Drupal module.

We recommend creating a custom `ys_base` module for your project to hold
general-purpose functionality that doesn’t belong in a dedicated,
feature-specific module.

The `ys` prefix is abbreviated from your project name (`your_site` in this case).
We recommend using this technique to prefix all modules, and use the site
machine name for a theme name.

:::info Token Replacement

  The `your_site`, `ys` prefix and other similar tokens are placeholders. They
  will be replaced with your actual project prefix when you install **Vortex**.

## Deploy file

The [`ys_base.deploy.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/develop/web/modules/custom/ys_base/ys_base.deploy.php)
file is an example of a Drush deploy file that can be used
to run deployment commands during the site [provisioning](provision) process.

## Tests scaffold

The `tests` directory contains working examples of tests that can be used as a
starting point in your project.

It also has a set of helper `Traits` that you may find useful when writing your
tests. Simply remove them if you do not need them.

See [Development](/docs/workflows/development) for more details on how to work with
the custom modules.
