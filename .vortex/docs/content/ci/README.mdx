**Vortex** offers GitHub Actions and CircleCI CI configurations to automate the
process of building, testing, and deploying your site.

The workflow configuration is identical for both CI providers. You would need to
choose one of them and follow the setup instructions.

The CI pipeline consists of multiple jobs executed in a containerized
environment to ensure consistency across runs.

## Trigger Conditions

The CI pipeline is triggered by:

- **Push events** to the following branches:
  - `production`,
  - `main`,
  - `master`,
  - `develop`
  - `release/**`,
  - `hotfix/**`,
  - `project/**`
- **Pull requests** to these branches
- **Scheduled runs** for automatic database caching

## Workflow Structure

### 1. Database

- Runs in a [`drevops/ci-runner`](https://github.com/drevops/ci-runner) _runner_ container
- Downloads the latest DB version based on a caching strategy
- Caches database dumps to speed up the follow-up runs

### 2. Build

- Runs after the `database` job
- Uses Docker Compose to set up the environment
- Provisions a website
- Lints code
- Runs unit tests
- Runs BDD tests
- Generates code coverage reports
- Collects and stores test results and artifacts

### 3. Deployment

- Runs after successful completion of a previous `build` job
- Uses the built codebase without development dependencies from the `build` step
- Adds required secrets and environment variables
- Triggers a deployment using a router script

## Caching Strategy

Database is downloaded overnight and cached so that the next CI run on the same
day uses the cached database dump.

By default, the database is cached per-branch for 24 hours. If cache is not
available, the fallback default branch is used.
