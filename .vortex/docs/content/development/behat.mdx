# Behat

**Vortex** uses [Behat](https://behat.org) for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
testing. Behat allows to write human-readable stories that describe the behavior
of the application. Behat tests primarily focus on critical user journeys,
serving as comprehensive end-to-end validations.

**Vortex** provides full Behat support, including configuration in [`behat.yml`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/behat.yml)
and a [browser container](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to run tests interactively in a real browser with
a VNC viewer.

Additional features include:

1. [Behat Drupal Extension](https://github.com/drupalprojects/drupalextension) - an extension to work with Drupal.
2. [Behat Steps](https://github.com/drevops/behat-steps) - a library of re-usable Behat steps.
3. [Behat Screenshot](https://github.com/drevops/behat-screenshot) - extension to capture screenshots on-demand and on failure.
4. [Behat Progress formatter](https://github.com/drevops/behat-format-progress-fail) - extension to show progress as TAP and failures inline.
5. Parallel profiles - configuration to allow running tests in parallel.

## Running tests

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    # Run all Behat tests
    ahoy test-bdd
    # Run specific feature file
    ahoy test-bdd tests/behat/features/homepage.feature
    # Run scenarios with specific tag
    ahoy test-bdd -- --tags=@smoke
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    # Run all Behat tests
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/behat
    # Run specific feature file
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/behat tests/behat/features/homepage.feature
    # Run scenarios with specific tag
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/behat -- --tags=@smoke
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Discovering available step definitions

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ahoy" label="Ahoy" default>
    ```shell
    # Generate step definitions reference
    ahoy test-bdd -- --definitions=l
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```shell
    # Generate step definitions reference
    docker compose exec cli vendor/bin/behat -- --definitions=l
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## FeatureContext

The [`FeatureContext.php`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/tests/behat/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php) file comes with
included steps from [Behat steps](https://github.com/drevops/behat-steps) package.

You can add your custom steps into this file.

## Profiles

Behat's `default` profile configured with sensible defaults to allow running it
with provided extensions.

In continuous integration environment, the profile can be overridden using \
`$VORTEX_CI_BEHAT_PROFILE` environment variable.

## Parallel runs

In continuous integration pipeline, Behat tests can run within multiple runners
to increase the speed of the test suite. To achieve this, Behat tags are used to
mark features and scenarios with `@p*` tags.

Out of the box, **Vortex** provides support for unlimited parallel
runners, but only 2 parallel profiles `p0` and `p1`: a feature can be tagged by
either `@p0` or `@p1` to run in a dedicated runner, or with both tags to run in
both runners.

Note that you can easily add more `p*` profiles in your `behat.yml` by copying
existing `p1` profile and changing several lines of configuration.

Features without `@p*` tags will always run in the first CI pipeline runner, so
even if you forget to tag the feature, it will still be allocated to a runner.

If CI pipeline has only one runner - a `default` profile will be used and all tests
(except for those that tagged with `@skipped`) will be run.

## Skipping tests

Add `@skipped` tag to a feature or scenario to exclude it from the test run.

## Screenshots

Test screenshots are stored into `.logs/screenshots` location by default,
which can be overwritten using `$BEHAT_SCREENSHOT_DIR` variable (courtesy of
[Behat Screenshot](https://github.com/drevops/behat-screenshot) package).

In continuous integration pipeline, screenshots are stored as build artifacts.
In GitHub Actions, they can be downloaded from the `Summary` tab.
In CircleCI they are accessible in the `Artifacts` tab.

## Format

Out of the box, **Vortex** comes with [Behat Progress formatter](https://github.com/drevops/behat-format-progress-fail)
output formatter to show progress as TAP and failures inline. This allows to
continue test runs after a failure while maintaining a minimal output.

## Reporting

Test reports are stored in `.logs/behat` directory.

Continuous integration pipeline usually uses them to track test performance and
stability.

## Boilerplate test features

**Vortex** provides BDD [tests boilerplate](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/tests/behat/features) for [homepage](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/tests/behat/features/homepage.feature)
and [login](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/tests/behat/features/login.feature)
user journeys.

These boilerplate tests run in continuous integration pipeline when you install
**Vortex** and can be used as a starting point for writing your own.

## Writing tests

For project-specific test writing conventions (user story format, standard user
types, test data conventions), see your project's `docs/testing.md` file.

The `docs/testing.md` file is scaffolded when you install **Vortex** and should
be maintained by your project team to document agreed-upon testing practices.
