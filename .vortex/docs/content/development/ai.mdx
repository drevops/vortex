# AI

**Vortex** provides built-in support for AI coding agents. The integration is
configured through structured markdown files that give agents the context they
need to work effectively within the project.

## How it works

The AI integration follows the same two-tier documentation pattern used
throughout **Vortex**:

- **What** applies to the project is defined in the `docs/` directory. The
  agent reads all files in `docs/` to understand project-specific decisions
  such as testing conventions, CI configuration, deployment rules, and
  release processes.
- **How** to perform operations is sourced from the
  https://www.vortextemplate.com/docs (this site). The
  `AGENTS.md` file instructs agents to fetch operational guides from the
  website and cache them locally in `.data/ai-artifacts/`.

This means AI agents receive the same layered guidance as human developers:
project-level decisions first, then Vortex-level procedures.

## Configuration files

### `AGENTS.md`

The [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/AGENTS.md) file
in the project root is the primary configuration for AI coding agents. It is
an agent-agnostic file that any AI tool can use.

Key sections include:

- **Daily development tasks** — a reference of `ahoy` commands for building,
  testing, and managing the local environment.
- **Critical rules** — constraints that agents must always follow (e.g., never
  modify `scripts/vortex/`, always export config after admin UI changes).
- **Key directories** — the project's directory layout.
- **Documentation** — instructions for agents to check `docs/` files for
  project-specific decisions and to fetch operational documentation from
  https://www.vortextemplate.com/docs. Fetched documentation is cached locally so
  that agents can reuse it across sessions without repeated requests.

### `CLAUDE.md`

The [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/drevops/vortex/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) file
is automatically loaded by Claude Code at the start of every session. It
references `AGENTS.md` for the full development guide.
