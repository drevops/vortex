## Hosting providers vs environments

Understanding the distinction between **hosting providers** and **environments**
is crucial for properly configuring and deploying your website.

### Hosting providers

**Hosting providers** are the platforms where your environments actually run.
They can be cloud-based or on-premises solutions that provide the infrastructure
to run the webserver, database, and other services required for your site.

Multiple environments can exist on the same hosting provider.

### Environments

**Environments** refer to the contained "bundles" of infrastructure services
that allow to "run" your website.

An environment represents a specific logical stage of your website deployment
and releasing lifecycle: from local development to production.

Hosting providers typically provide DEV, STAGE, and PROD environments.

Some providers also support additional short-lived ephemeral environments also
called "preview", "on-demand", or "feature" environments. These help to test
new features or changes in isolation before merging them into the main codebase.

**Vortex** provides a mechanism to detect the environment type and allows you to
configure your website behavior based on this environment type. Read more about
[Environment type detection](../drupal/settings#environment-type-detection).
