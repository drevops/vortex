- [Acquia](/docs/hosting/acquia)
- [Lagoon](/docs/hosting/lagoon)

:::info More integrations coming soon

  We will be adding more hosting provider integrations in the future.

The deployment pipelines to all environments of these providers are streamlined
and automated to ensure that the deployment process is consistent and reliable.

## Hosting providers vs environments

Understanding the distinction between **hosting providers** and **environments**
is crucial for properly configuring and deploying your website.

### Hosting providers

**Hosting providers** are the _platforms_ where your _environments_ actually run.
They can be cloud-based or on-premises solutions that provide the infrastructure
to run the webserver, database, and other services required for your site.

Multiple _environments_ can exist on the same _hosting provider_.

### Environments

**Environments** refer to the contained _bundles_ of infrastructure services
that allow to _run_ your website.

An environment represents a specific logical stage of your website deployment
and releasing lifecycle: from local development to production.

Hosting providers typically provide DEV, STAGE, and PROD environments.

Some providers also support additional short-lived ephemeral environments also
called "preview", "on-demand", or "feature" environments. These help to test
new features or changes in isolation before merging them into the main codebase.

**Vortex** provides a mechanism to detect the environment type and allows you to
configure your website behavior based on this environment type.
