    # for most use-cases, including multi-site deployments. However, if it is
    # desired that a session can be reused across different subdomains, the
    # cookie domain needs to be set to the shared base domain. Doing so assures
    # that users remain logged in as they cross between various subdomains.
    # To maximize compatibility and normalize the behavior across user agents,
    # the cookie domain should start with a dot.
    #

    # Twig debugging:
    #
    # When debugging is enabled:
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that

    # - Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    #   check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'debug'
    #   should be set to FALSE.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
