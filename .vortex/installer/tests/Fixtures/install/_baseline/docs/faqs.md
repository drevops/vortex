1. Run `ahoy debug`.
2. Enable listening for incoming debug connections in your IDE.
3. If required, provide server URL to your IDE as it appears in the browser.
4. Enable Xdebug flag in the request coming from your web browser (use one of
   the extensions or add `?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1` to your URL).

## What should I do to switch to a "clean" branch environment?

Provided that your stack is already running:

1. Switch to your branch
2. `composer install`
3. `ahoy provision`

Note that you do not need to rebuild the full stack using `ahoy build` every
time.
However, sometimes you would want to have an absolutely clean environment - in
that case, use `ahoy build`.

## How to just import a database?

Provided that your stack is already running:

```bash
ahoy drush sql-drop -y;

```

But better:

```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/somepackage": {
            "Patch description": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/issue.patch"
        }
    }
}
```

2. Run

```bash
composer require drupal/somepackage
```

## How to set a custom maintenance theme?

To set a custom theme for Drupal's maintenance mode (when the site is offline for updates), set the `DRUPAL_MAINTENANCE_THEME` environment variable:

```bash
# In .env file
DRUPAL_MAINTENANCE_THEME=my_custom_theme
```

This theme will be used when Drupal is in maintenance mode. If `DRUPAL_MAINTENANCE_THEME` is not set, the system will fall back to using the value of `DRUPAL_THEME`.

The maintenance theme should be a valid Drupal theme that is already installed and enabled on your site.
