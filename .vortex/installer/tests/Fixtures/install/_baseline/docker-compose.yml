# Docker Compose configuration file.

# - Using a single file to work in local, CI and production environments.
# - Local overrides are possible using docker-compose.override.yml file.
# - Environment variables are read from .env file.
# - Containers will be named after the project directory.
# - Use inline comments containing '###' to have the line removed in CI.
# - Use inline comments starting with '##' to have the line being automatically
#   uncommented in CI.
