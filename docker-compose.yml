  #: Understanding host mounting in Docker-based projects.
  #:
  #: To share application code between services (containers), Docker uses volumes.
  #: When used in non-development environments, containers have access to
  #: the same shared files using volumes and these volumes do not need to be
  #: mounted from the host. But for development environment, when the code
  #: constantly changes on the host, we need to have these changes synchronized
  #: into all containers. Since we are using single `docker-compose.yml` file for
  #: all environments, we have to accommodate both cases, so we are specifying an
  #: override for the same directory as a mounted volume as a commented-out lines,
  #: which will be automatically uncommented in CI.
  #:
  #: See Docker Compose reference about volumes https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference
