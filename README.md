## Understanding DrevOps
DrevOps is a Drupal project scaffolding template with included development 
environment, CI configuration and tools. It can be used on new or existing 
projects as is or can be customized as required. It may also be used as a 
reference for custom configurations. 

DrevOps is designed to support updating of the code templates it provides. 
This makes it easy to keep projects using DrevOps up-to-date with the latest
scaffolding code.  

DrevOps supports both database-driven development and fresh install for every 
build. Database-driven development is when the existing production database is 
used for every build (useful for product development), while fresh install is 
when the site is installed from the scratch during every build (useful for 
module or profile development).  

DrevOps has own automated tests that guarantees stability and ease of maintenance.

### What is the problem that DrevOps is trying to solve?
Increase the quality of the produced Drupal websites with minimum setup effort and knowledge.

### Why is this problem important?
High quality Drupal websites are stable, secure, faster and safer to change.

But developers do not always have the time or skills to setup the tools required 
to produce and maintain high-quality Drupal websites.

### How does DrevOps solve it?
Quick install of best practices Drupal configuration on Docker stack using a 
single command lowers entry barrier, while unification of the developer's 
experience improves development speed across projects.

### Who is it for?
- Digital agencies that want to standardise their development stack (standard 
  operating environment) across projects
- Developers that are looking for best practices
- Developers that do not possess required time or knowledge to setup these tools 
  themselves 

### How does it work?
- You run installer script once
- DrevOps brings the latest release into your codebase
- You commit all new files
- If required, you may override files with changes relevant only to a specific 
  project.  

### What if I don't like the defaults this project provides?
Since DrevOps is a template, it can be forked and adjusted to your needs. The 
installer script will continue to work with your fork, provided that you adjust
several environment variables. 

**In other words - you will have your own development templates for your own 
projects  the way you want it!**

### Installation

1. Install DrevOps<br/>
   For interactive installation (questions and answers) into current directory:
   ```
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drevops/drevops/8.x/install.php > /tmp/install.php && php /tmp/install.php --interactive; rm /tmp/install.php
   ```

   For quiet installation with default settings into current directory:    
   ```
   curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drevops/drevops/8.x/install.php > /tmp/install.php && php /tmp/install.php; rm /tmp/install.php
   ```

## Why is DrevOps awesome?
- **Highly configurable**  <br/>
  All configuration is made through environment variables without the need to change any of the scripts.
- **Flexible**<br/>
  Anything can be overridden for your specific project and will not be lost during the next update.
- **Pure Docker stack**  <br/>
  No special binaries to work with Docker. No generated Docker Compose configurations from custom configurations. Modify configuration to fit your project needs.
- **Tested**  <br/>
  There are tests for workflows, configuration, deployments, CI. Everything. And they run automatically on every commit.
- **Versioned**  <br/>
  It is always clear which version of the stack your site uses.
- **Upgradable**  <br/>
  Your website can be updated to a newer version of DrevOps with minimal effort. Your project customisations are easily preserved.
- **Documented**  <br/>
  The major areas of DrevOps are explicitly documented, while most of the code is self-documented.

## What areas does DrevOps cover?
- Drupal
- Local development environment
- Code linting
- Testing
- Automated builds (CI)
- Deployment
- Documentation
- Integrations
- Maintenance

</details>

## Contributing
- Progress is tracked as [GitHub project](https://github.com/drevops/drevops/projects/1). 
- Development takes place in 2 independent branches named after Drupal core version: `7.x` or `8.x`.
- Create an issue and prefix title with Drupal core version: `[8.x] Updated readme file.`. 
- Create PRs with branches prefixed with Drupal core version: `7.x` or `8.x`. For example, `feature/8.x-updated-readme`.

### Main concepts behind DrevOps
- **Fetch as much of development configuration as possible from DrevOps repository**<br/>
  Allows to keep your project up-to-date with DrevOps  
- **Avoid adding things to the wrong places**<br/> 
  Example: Using Composer scripts for workflow commands. Instead, use tools specifically designed for this, like Ahoy
- **Abstract similar functionality into steps**<br/> 
  Allows to apply changes at the larger scale without the need to modify each project
- **Run the most of the code in the containers**<br/> 
  Reduces the number of required tools on the host machine

### Updating development stack

Development stack needs to be downloaded for each environment, but some files may be committed to the project repository.
Update process brings new versions of development stack files and may overwrite some of them. The changes in these files 
need to be reviewed and selectively committed. 

1. Start a new branch to make sure that your changes do not affect the main branch   
2. Run `ahoy update` to download the latest version of the development stack 
3. Review and commit changes 
4. Make sure that your CI build passes with updated development stack configuration
5. Merge your changes to the main branch    

## Adding Drupal modules

`composer require drupal/module_name`

## Adding patches for Drupal modules

1. Add `title` and `url` to patch on https://drupal.org to the `patches` array in `extra` section in `composer.json`.

```
    "extra": {
        "patches": {
            "drupal/core": {
                "Contextual links should not be added inside another link - https://www.drupal.org/node/2898875": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/contextual_links_should-2898875-3.patch"
            }
        }    
    }
```

2. `composer update --lock`

## Front-end and Livereload
- `ahoy fe` - build SCSS and JS assets.
- `ahoy fed` - build SCSS and JS assets for development.
- `ahoy few` - watch asset changes and reload the browser (using Livereload). To enable Livereload integration with Drupal, add to `settings.php` file (already added to `settings.local.php`): 
  ```
  $settings['livereload'] = TRUE;
  ```

## Coding standards
PHP and JS code linting uses [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with Drupal rules from [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) module and additional local overrides in `phpcs.xml` and `.eslintrc.json`.   

SASS and SCSS code linting use [Sass Lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) with additional local overrides in `.sass-lint.yml`.

Set `ALLOW_LINT_FAIL=1` in `.env` to allow lint failures.

## Behat tests
Behat configuration uses multiple extensions: 
- [Drupal Behat Extension](https://github.com/jhedstrom/drupalextension) - Drupal integration layer. Allows to work with Drupal API from within step definitions.
- [Behat Screenshot Extension](https://github.com/integratedexperts/behat-screenshot) - Behat extension and a step definition to create HTML and image screenshots on demand or test fail.
- [Behat Progress Fail Output Extension](https://github.com/integratedexperts/behat-format-progress-fail) - Behat output formatter to show progress as TAP and fail messages inline. Useful to get feedback about failed tests while continuing test run.
- `FeatureContext` - Site-specific context with custom step definitions.

Add `@skipped` tag to failing tests if you would like to skip them.  

## Automated builds (Continuous Integration)
In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. 
Before feature changes can be merged into a shared mainline, a complete build must run and pass all tests on CI server.

This project uses [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) as a CI server: it imports production backups into fully built codebase and runs code linting and tests. When tests pass, a deployment process is triggered for nominated branches (usually, `master` and `develop`).

Add `[skip ci]` to the commit subject to skip CI build. Useful for documentation changes.

### SSH
Circle CI supports shell access to the build for 120 minutes after the build is finished when the build is started with SSH support. Use "Rerun job with SSH" button in Circle CI UI to start build with SSH support.

### Cache
Circle CI supports caching between builds. The cache takes care of saving the state of your dependencies between builds, therefore making the builds run faster.
Each branch of your project will have a separate cache. If it is the very first build for a branch, the cache from the default branch on GitHub (normally `master`) will be used. If there is no cache for master, the cache from other branches will be used.
If the build has inconsistent results (build fails in CI but passes locally), try to re-running the build without cache by clicking 'Rebuild without cache' button.

### Test artifacts
Test artifacts (screenshots etc.) are available under "Artifacts" tab in Circle CI UI.
