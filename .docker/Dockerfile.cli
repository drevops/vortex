#: Strating from this line, Docker will add result of each command into a
#: separate layer. These layers are then cached, and re-used when project is
#: rebuilt.
#: Note that layers are rebuilt only if files added into image with `ADD`
#: have changed since the last build. So adding files that are most like to be
#: rarely changed earlier in the build process (closer to the start of this
#: file) adds more efficiency when working with stack - layers will be rarely
#: rebuilt.

#: Adding more tools.
RUN apk update \
    && apk add pv \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

#: Adding patches and scripts.
ADD patches /app/patches
ADD scripts /app/scripts

#: Copy files required for PHP dependencies resolution.
#: Note that composer.lock is not explicitly copied, allowing to run the stack
#: without existing lock file (this is not advisable, but allows to build
#: using latest versions of packages). composer.lock should be comitted to the
#: repository.
#: File .env (and other environment files) is copied into image as it may be
#: required by composer scripts to get some additions variables.
COPY composer.json composer.* .env* /app/

#: Install PHP dependencies, but without development dependencies. This is very
#: important, because we do not want potential security issues to be exposed to
#: production environment.
RUN echo "memory_limit=-1" >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini \
    && composer install -n --no-dev --ansi --prefer-dist --no-suggest --optimize-autoloader \
    && rm -rf /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/memory.ini

#: Install NodeJS dependencies.
#: Note that package-lock.json is not explicitly copied, allowing to run the
#: stack without existing lock file (this is not advisable, but allows to build
#: using latest versions of packages). package-lock.json should be comitted to
#: the repository.
#: File Gruntfile.sj is copied into image as it is required to generate
#: front-end assets.
COPY docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme/Gruntfile.js docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme/.eslintrc.json docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme/package.json docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme/package* /app/docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme/

#: Install NodeJS dependencies.
#: Since Drupal does not use NodeJS for production, it does not matter if we
#; install development dependencnies here - they are not exposed in any way.
RUN cd docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme && npm install

#: Copy all files into appllication source directory. Existing files are always
#: overridden.
COPY . /app

#: Compile front-end assets. Running this after copying all files as we need
#: sources to compile assets.
RUN cd docroot/sites/all/themes/custom/your_site_theme && npm run build
